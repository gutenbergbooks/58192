<p>They sang it at the top of their voices as they
came down the hill, arm in arm, and crossed the
meadow toward the village. There was no one to
hear, and they wouldn’t have cared if there had
been. Tom Dyer sang the bass, Alf Loring the
tenor and Dan Vinton whatever was most convenient,
since about the best he could do in a musical
way was to make a noise. It was a glorious morning,
in the middle of October, and there was a
frosty nip in the air that made one want to sing or
dance, and as they were in a hurry and dancing
would have delayed them, they sang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s a bully song, Dan,” said Alf. “You
ought to think of another verse, though, something
with more ginger in it. How’s this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘We will knock them full of dents<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we’ll send them home in splints?’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Rotten,” growled Tom. “It doesn’t rhyme.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t have to rhyme,” said Alf. “It’s
poetic license.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re no poet. What you need is a
dog license, Alf!”</p>

<p>“He’s just peeved because he didn’t think of it
himself,” explained Alf to Dan. “He’s one of the
most envious dubs in school. Personally I consider
it a very pretty sentiment and just chock-full
of—er—poetic feeling. And I won’t charge you a
cent for it, Dan; it’s yours. No, no, not a word!
I won’t be thanked.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, you won’t be,” said Tom. “If
you put that in the song, Dan, I’ll stop playing,
and howl!”</p>

<p>“That might be a good idea,” responded Alf.
“I’ll bet you’d cut more ice howling than you
would playing, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try and think of another verse,” said Dan.
“But I don’t think I’ll work in anything about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
dents and splints, Alf. Besides, that doesn’t
sound very well coming from the captain. Remember
that you’re a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“He knows better than that; don’t you?” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“I know I’ll roll you around in the dust if you
don’t shut up, you old Pudding Head!” answered
Alf truculently.</p>

<p>“Come on, you fellows,” interrupted Dan.
“We haven’t any time for scrapping if we’re going
to get there to see the start.”</p>

<p>“How far do they run?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“About three miles,” replied Dan, as he
climbed the fence and jumped down into the road.
“They start at the corner beyond the bridge, take
the Broadwood road and circle back beyond
Greenburg and finish at the bridge again.”</p>

<p>“Is that the route when they run against
Broadwood?” Alf inquired as they went on toward
the Wissining station.</p>

<p>“Yes, only then they’ll start at the Cider Mill
and finish a mile beyond toward Broadwood, and
that makes it a mile longer.”</p>

<p>“Suppose little Geraldine will have any
show?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Alf. He’s been at it ever since
school began, though. He asked me if I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
he could make a cross-country runner and I told
him to go ahead and try. I knew it wouldn’t do
him a bit of harm, anyway, and he was sort of
sore because Bendix wouldn’t pass him for
football.”</p>

<p>“Bendix was right, too,” said Tom. “Gerald’s
too young and weak to tackle football.”</p>

<p>“He’s fifteen,” objected Alf, “and, as for
being weak, well, I know he handed me some nasty
jabs in the gym last week when we boxed. They
didn’t <em>feel</em> weak.”</p>

<p>“His father didn’t want him to play this fall,”
said Dan, “and I’m glad he’s not going to. If he
got hurt, Mr. Pennimore would sort of hold me to
blame, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Glad I’m not responsible for that kid,”
laughed Alf. “You’ll have your hands full by
next year, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will be able to look after himself pretty
soon, I fancy. They haven’t started yet; let’s get
a move on.”</p>

<p>They hurried their pace past the station and
across the bridge which spans the river just beyond
and connects Wissining with Greenburg.
Anyone meeting them would, I think, have
given them more than a second glance, for one
doesn’t often encounter three finer examples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the American schoolboy. Dan Vinton was in his
second year at Yardley Hall School and was sixteen
years of age. He was tall and somewhat
lean, although by lean I don’t mean what he himself
would have called “skinny.” He had brown
eyes, at once steady and alert, a very straight,
well-formed nose, a strong chin and a mouth that
usually held a quiet smile. He was in the Second
Class this year and, like his companions,
was a member of the football team, playing at
right end.</p>

<p>Alfred Loring was eighteen, a member of the
First Class, captain of the eleven and of the
hockey team. He was scarcely an inch taller than
Dan, in spite of his advantage in age, and, like
Dan, hadn’t an ounce of superfluous flesh on his
well-built frame. He had a merry, careless face,
snapping dark brown eyes, an aquiline nose and
hair which he wore parted in the middle and
brushed closely to his head. He was as good a
quarter-back as Yardley had ever had and this
year, with Alf at the head of the team, the school
expected great things.</p>

<p>Tom Dyer, his roommate, was a big, rangy,
powerful-looking chap, rather silent, rather sleepy
looking, with features that didn’t make for beauty.
But he had nice gray eyes and a pleasant smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and was one of the best-hearted fellows in school.
Tom was captain of the basket-ball team, a First
Class man and in age was Alf’s senior by two
months. All three of them were dressed in old
trousers and sweaters that had seen much use,
and all three wore on the backs of their heads the
little dark-blue caps with the white Y’s that in
school heraldry proclaimed them members of the
Yardley Hall Football Team.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond the bridge, on the outskirts
of Greenburg, they joined a throng of some
eighty or ninety boys. Of this number some thirty
or so were attired for running and were engaged
in keeping warm by walking or trotting around in
circles or slapping their legs. The trio responded
to greetings as they pushed through the crowd.
Andy Ryan, the little sandy-haired, green-eyed
trainer, was in charge of the proceedings and was
calling names from a list which he held in his
hand.</p>

<p>“All right now, byes,” he announced. “You
know the way. The first twelve to finish will get
places. Get ready and I’ll send you off.”</p>

<p>“There’s Gerald,” said Alf, pointing to a
youngster who, in a modest attire of sleeveless
shirt, short running trunks and spiked shoes, was
stepping eagerly about at a little distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
“Looks as though he could run, doesn’t he? Good
muscles in those legs of his. That’s what boxing
does for you.”</p>

<p>“There he goes,” groaned Tom. “Honest,
Dan, he thinks boxing will do anything from developing
the feet to raising hair on a bald head!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Alf stoutly. “It’ll develop
the muscles of the legs, my friend, just
about as much as any other muscles. O-oh,
Gerald!”</p>

<p>Gerald Pennimore looked around, smiled, and
waved his hand. He was a good-looking youngster
of fifteen, with an eager, expressive face, a
lithe body that needed development, and a coloring
that was almost girlish. His eyes were very
blue and his skin was fair in spite of the fact that
he had tried hard all the summer to get it tanned
like Dan’s. What bothered him more than all else,
however, was the fact that his cheeks were pink
and that the least emotion made him redden up
like a girl. His hair, which he kept cut as short
as possible, was the color of corn tassels, but the
summer had streaked it with darker tones and
Gerald was hopeful that in time it would all turn
to an ordinary shade of brown. Another trial
that he had to endure was being thought even
younger than he was. It was bad enough to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
only fifteen when the fellows you most liked
were from one to three years older, but to have
folks guess your age as fourteen was very discouraging.</p>

<p>“All ready!” warned Andy Ryan.</p>

<p>Gerald poised himself in the second line of
starters and waited eagerly, impatiently for the
word. Then it came and he bounded off as though
the race was a quarter-mile run instead of a three-mile
jaunt over a hard road and some rough hills
and meadows.</p>

<p>“Easy, Gerald!” cautioned Dan as the runners
swept by. “Get your wind. Hello, Thompson!
Hello, Joe! Stick to ’em!”</p>

<p>“There’s that chap Hiltz,” said Alf. “Didn’t
know he had enough energy to run. By the way,
we mustn’t forget about the Cambridge Society
election next month. You’ve got to beat Hiltz out,
you know, if we are to get Gerald in as we promised.
Hiltz and Thompson were the Third Class
members of the Admission Committee last year
and I suppose they’ll be up for election from the
Second Class this year. We must find out about
that, and if Hiltz is going to try to get in again
you must do a little canvassing on your own hook.
We’ll organize a campaign. You can beat him,
though, without trying, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“We made a mistake in thinking it was
Thompson who blackballed Gerald in May, didn’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess Thompson’s a pretty square sort
of chap. He and Gerald are quite thick this year.”</p>

<p>The runners trotted out of sight around a bend
of the road and the three boys perched themselves
on the top rail of the fence and, with the others,
waited for the runners to return. Cross-country
running was something new at Yardley. The
sport had been growing in popularity among the
colleges and from them was spreading to the
preparatory schools. Broadwood, Yardley’s chief
rival, had sent a challenge in September and it
had been accepted. Since then the school had
been quite mad on the subject of cross-country
running, and Andy Ryan, in the interims of his
work with the football players, had been busy
training candidates for a cross-country team to
meet Broadwood. The dual meet was to take
place on the morning of November 21st, on the
afternoon of which day Yardley and Broadwood
would clash in the final football game at Broadwood,
some four miles distant. Each team was to
consist of ten runners, and to-day’s try-out was to
enable the trainer to select a dozen of the numerous
candidates, two of them to be substitutes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
newly formed team was to elect a captain that
evening.</p>

<p>Cross-country running, however, didn’t long
engage the attention of the three on the fence.
The conversation soon turned to football, which,
since they were all players, was only natural.
They discussed that afternoon’s game with St.
John’s Academy, which, although of minor importance
and not difficult, was the last of the preliminary
contests and would settle the fate of more
than one player.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget, fellows, that I want to stop and
see Payson on the way back,” said Alf. “He
thinks we ought to play two twenty-minute halves,
but I think a twenty and a fifteen would be better.
It will be fairly warm this afternoon. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” answered Tom indifferently.
“Let’s play what they want to play.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t up to them,” said Alf. “We fix the
length of halves. It’s all well enough for you,
Tom; you’re a regular ox for work; but some of
the new chaps will feel the pace, I guess.”</p>

<p>“How long will the halves be next week with
Carrel’s?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Twenty, I suppose. We don’t usually play
twenty-fives until the Brewer game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then thirty-five minutes altogether ought to
be enough for to-day, I would say. Although I
don’t care as far as I’m concerned.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stop and talk it over with Payson,” said
Alf. “Did you hear that Warren, the Princeton
center of last year, is going to help coach at
Broadwood this fall?”</p>

<p>“No, really?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“That’s what I heard. I wish we could get a
good chap to help Payson. We ought to have
some one to coach the back field on catching punts
and running back; some one who could come down
here after the Brewer game and put in two good
hard weeks.”</p>

<p>“How about that brother of yours?” asked
Tom. Alf shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“He won’t be able to get away much. He’s
going to come when he can, but he knows only
about line men. Considering the number of fellows
we send to Yale I think they might help us
out a little with the coaching.”</p>

<p>“Have they ever been asked to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a couple of years ago we tried to get
them to send some one down, and they did send a
chap for a week or so, but he wasn’t much good;
just stood around and criticized the plays we were
using. What we need is some one who’ll take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
coat off and knock some plain horse-sense into the
fellows. I think I’ll talk to Payson about it and
see what he thinks.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” said Tom. “Colton’s on
the Yale freshman team. Why not write to him
and see what he can do?”</p>

<p>“Colton,” answered Alf dryly, “was a great
big thing when he was captain here last year, but
just at present he’s only one of some sixty or seventy
candidates trying for a place on the freshman
eleven. I guess he has all the trouble he
wants. Look, isn’t that one of our long-distance
heroes footing it down the road there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dan. “Come on.”</p>

<p>They jumped down and hurried over to the
finish line.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” some one cried, and there
was a rush for places of observation. Andy Ryan
got his pencil ready and handed his stop watch to
Alf.</p>

<p>“Take the time of the first three,” he directed.</p>

<p>“Track! Track!” The first runner trotted
down the road looking rather fagged and as the
trainer set his name down he crossed the line and
staggered tiredly into the arms of a friend. He
was Goodyear, a Second Class fellow. Fifty yards
behind three runners were fighting hard for second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
place. They finally finished within ten feet
of each other and Ryan entered their names: Henderson,
Wagner, French. Two minutes passed
before the next man came into sight.</p>

<p>“That’s young Thompson,” said Alf. “He
doesn’t look as though the distance had troubled
him much, does he? Good work, Thompson! See
anything of Pennimore up the line?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Arthur Thompson as he
joined them, breathing hard but seemingly quite
fresh after his three-mile spin. “I passed him
about a mile back. He looked pretty fit, Loring,
and I guess he’ll finish. I hope he does.”</p>

<p>Four boys came down the road well bunched
and there was a good-natured struggle for supremacy
as they neared the waiting group. “Norcross,
Maury, Felder, Garson,” called Andy Ryan
as they crossed the line. “Don’t stand around
here, byes; go home and get a shower right off.”</p>

<p>“That’s nine,” said Alf. “Any more in sight?
If Gerald doesn’t finish one of the next three he’s
dished. Here’s another chap now. It isn’t Gerald
though, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not Gerald,” said Tom. “It’s—What’s-his-name?—Sherwood,
of your class,
Dan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him. Good for you, Sher!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
You’ve got a dandy color!” Sherwood grinned as
he trotted by. There was another wait and then
another runner came into sight at the turn, and a
second later two more, running side by side.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’ll be a race!” exclaimed Dan.
“Only two of them will get places. By Jove, fellows,
one of them’s Gerald. See him?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, and the fellow with him is
Hiltz.” Alf chuckled. “Here’s a fine chance for
him to get even with Hiltz for queering him with
Cambridge last spring. I wonder if he can do it.”</p>

<p>The first of the three, glancing back, eased his
pace and finished a good twenty yards ahead, very
tired. Gerald Pennimore and Jake Hiltz were
struggling gamely for the twelfth place in the
race. As they came near Alf gave a whoop.</p>

<p>“Gerald’s got it!” he cried. “Come on, you
Geraldine! You’ve got him beat! Dig your
spikes, boy! Don’t let up!”</p>

<p>It was a battle royal for a dozen yards at the
finish, but <a href="#i_frontis">Gerald drew ahead steadily</a>, turning
once to look at his adversary, and crossed the line
two yards to the good, Alf and Tom and Dan running
out to seize him in case he fell.</p>

<p>But Gerald had no idea of falling. Instead he
walked off the road, resisting the outstretched
arms, and sat down on a rock, looking up a trifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
breathlessly but quite smilingly at his solicitous
friends.</p>

<p>“I was twelfth, wasn’t I?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“You’re the even dozen, Gerald,” said Dan.
“How’d you do it?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t hard,” answered Gerald. “I could
have finished ahead of that fellow Groom if I’d
wanted to, but I thought I’d rather have some fun
with Hiltz. He was all in long ago.”</p>

<p>This was quite evidently so, for Hiltz was
lying on his back struggling for breath, with a
friend supporting his head.</p>

<p>“Gerald,” said Alf sorrowfully, “I’m afraid
that’s not a Christian spirit. You should—er—love
your enemy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I love him better now,” laughed Gerald,
holding out his hand to be helped up. “I guess
I’ve got even with him for keeping me out of
Cambridge last year, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“You have,” said Tom. “Get your bath robe
and come on home. You fellows trot along and
see Payson, if you want to; I’ll go back with the
kid.”</p>

</div>


<p>When they had crossed the bridge the four
talked a while of the comet and then Dan and Alf
turned to the right toward the little buff house
wherein Payson, the football coach, had his lodgings,
and Tom and Gerald kept on in the direction
of the school. Ahead of them was a straggling
line of fellows whose eager voices reached
them crisply on the morning air.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you tired?” asked Tom with a solicitous
glance at the younger boy. Gerald shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, Tom. You see, I’ve been at it ever
since school opened. It’s wonderful the way practice
brings you along. Why, when I started out I
used to lose my breath in the first mile! Now I
think I could run six miles and not get much
winded. And you ought to see how my chest is
expanding!”</p>

<p>“If Alf were here,” laughed Tom, “he’d tell
you that was due to boxing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“I dare say some of it is,” responded Gerald
smilingly. “I hope Andy will let me in the run
with Broadwood. I suppose he will give us a lot
of stiff work before that, though. Are you going
to play this afternoon, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Alf’s gone to see Payson about the
length of halves. Payson wants two twenties and
Alf thinks that’s too much.”</p>

<p>“I wish Bendix would let me play,” sighed
Gerald. “Don’t you think it’s mean of him, Tom?
He says I’m not strong enough, but I’ll wager
I’m as strong as lots of the fellows on the
Second.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not, kid. You wait until next
year. Muscles knows what he’s talking about.
Football’s a tough game to play and a fellow needs
to be pretty sturdy if he isn’t going to get banged
up. I like the game mighty well, but if I had a
kid of my own I don’t believe I’d let him look at a
football before he was eighteen.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I’d hate to be your kid!” Gerald
laughed. “Think of the fun he’d miss! I’m going
to play next fall, all right. Dad doesn’t like it, but
he’s pretty fussy about me.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he be?” asked Tom. “You’re
the only one he’s got, aren’t you? If you get killed
who’s going to be the next Steamship King?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d rather be a lawyer,” said Gerald thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have enough money to be what
you like, I guess. It won’t matter whether you get
a case or not.”</p>

<p>“Dad doesn’t want me to be that, though,”
answered Gerald as they climbed the fence and
set off up the well-worn path across the meadow
slope. “He says I ought to study law but he
wants me to go into his office when I finish
college.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be glad you’ve got a fine big
business all ready and waiting,” said Tom. “By
the way, where is that father of yours now, Gerald?
I haven’t seen him lately, have I?”</p>

<p>“He’s out West; Chicago, to-day, I think.
He’s coming back the middle of next week. You
and Alf and Dan are to take dinner with us some
night after he comes home.”</p>

<p>“Glad to.” Tom unconsciously looked back
across the village to where the stone gables and
turrets of Sound View, the summer home of
the millionaire Steamship King, arose above the
trees. “How long are you going to keep the house
open this fall, Gerald?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Until after Thanksgiving, I suppose. Dad
will be away a good deal, though. You know he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
combining a lot of steamship lines on the Lakes.
It’s keeping him pretty busy.”</p>

<p>“I should think it might,” said Tom dryly.
“I guess it would be a good morning’s work
for me.”</p>

<p>They climbed The Prospect, as the terrace in
front of Oxford Hall is called, and parted company,
Tom disappearing around the corner of the
old granite building in the direction of his room
in Dudley Hall and Gerald following the drive
past Merle Hall to the gymnasium. The locker
room was pretty well filled with boys when he entered
and he fancied that the conversation, which
had sounded animated enough through the folding
doors, died suddenly at his appearance. He
nodded to several of the fellows, among them
Arthur Thompson, and crossed to his locker.
From the showers came the rush of water and the
yelps and groans of youths undergoing what in
Yardley parlance was known as the Third Degree.
The chatter began again as Gerald slipped out of
his running costume and, wrapping his big Turkish
towel about him, sought the baths. They were
all occupied, however, and he turned back to wait
his turn. Arthur Thompson was dressing a few
feet away and Gerald seated himself beside him
on the bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d punch Hiltz’s head,” Thompson growled
under his breath.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“What for! Haven’t you heard what he’s
saying?”</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head.</p>

<p>“No. What’s he saying, Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Why, that you cut the course coming back.
He’s told Andy Ryan and about everyone else.
He wants you disqualified. That would give him
a place on the team, you see. I thought you’d
heard it.”</p>

<p>“Do the fellows believe it?” asked Gerald.
His voice shook a little and he felt the blood dyeing
his cheeks.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Arthur in a low
voice. “I don’t. Jake Hiltz always was a liar.
I wouldn’t believe him if he told me his own
name!”</p>

<p>“Is he here?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere; in the shower, I guess. What
are you going to do, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make him say it to me,” answered
Gerald hotly.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t have any fuss with him,” Arthur
advised. “He’s bigger than you and a couple of
years older.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t care how big he is. If he says I
cheated, he lies!”</p>

<p>Gerald had unconsciously raised his voice and
a big, ungainly looking youth, who at that moment
emerged from one of the showers, heard and
turned toward them.</p>

<p>“Who lies, Pennimore?” he demanded threateningly.</p>

<p>“You do if you say I cheated this morning,
Hiltz!”</p>

<p>“You look out, Money-bags, or you’ll get something
you won’t like,” threatened Hiltz.</p>

<p>“Then you take that back,” said Gerald shrilly.</p>

<p>“Take back nothing! I said you cut the
course, and you did, and you know you did. You
gained at least twenty yards on me. If it wasn’t
for that I’d have beaten you easily.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie!”</p>

<p>Hiltz stepped forward and aimed a blow at
Gerald, but Arthur Thompson caught the older
boy’s fist on his arm.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Hiltz,” he growled. “He’s only
half your size.”</p>

<p>“He called me a liar!”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? I wouldn’t believe you on
oath, Hiltz. I don’t believe he cut the course.”</p>

<p>“Nobody cares what you believe,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Hiltz savagely. “I’ve put it up to Ryan and Mr.
Bendix and they’ll settle it without your help, my
fresh friend.”</p>

<p>“Where did I cut the course?” Gerald demanded.</p>

<p>“You know well enough,” responded Hiltz.
“At the first turn going into Greenburg. You cut
across the field when you ought to have kept to the
road.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t! Groom can prove it. He was right
ahead all the time. Did I, Groom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered that youth from the
other end of the room. “I wasn’t looking.” Evidently
he didn’t want to be drawn into the discussion.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t,” reiterated Gerald. “I was
right beside you all the last two miles, Hiltz, and
you know it very well.”</p>

<p>“I’ve said what I know. We’ll see whether
you can cheat me out of my place on the team. If
you weren’t so small I’d give you a mighty good
licking for talking like that to me.”</p>

<p>“Never mind my size,” cried Gerald, rushing
past Arthur. “I’m not afraid of you! I said you
lied, and I say it again!”</p>

<p>“Cut that out, Pennimore!” interrupted a big
chap who had entered. He was Durfee, a First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Class fellow, and captain of the Baseball Team.
“You’re not big enough to fight Hiltz, so don’t
call him names. What’s the row, anyway?”</p>

<p>“He says I cheated!” cried Gerald, almost on
the verge of tears. “He’s told Ryan that I cut
the course! He’s told everyone.”</p>

<p>“Well, did you?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“All right; let it go at that. He says you did,
you say you didn’t. Your word’s as good as his,
I suppose. Let Ryan settle it. Move along, Jake,
you’re blocking the traffic.”</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly willing to let Ryan settle it,”
said Hiltz, as he drew away. “But I’m not going
to have that little bug call me names.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tut, tut!” said Durfee, shoving him playfully
away. “It’s a pity about you, Jake. Run
along now. As for you, Pennimore, just remember
that it isn’t good form to call names, especially
to upper classmen. Besides which,” he
added with a smile, “it isn’t wise.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of him,” said Gerald. Durfee
grinned and winked at Arthur Thompson.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be either,” he muttered as he
turned away.</p>

<p>“You’d better see Ryan as soon as you can and
tell him your side of it,” Arthur advised. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
pretty sure Hiltz made it up because you beat him
out at the finish.”</p>

<p>“Groom knows I didn’t cheat,” said Gerald
aggrievedly. “He just doesn’t want to say so.”</p>

<p>“Groom is all for the peaceful life,” answered
Arthur. “Maybe, though, Bendix will get him to
fess up.”</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t, how can I prove that Hiltz
isn’t right?”</p>

<p>“You can’t, I suppose. And Hiltz can’t prove
that you’re not right. So there you are. Run
along and get your shower. I’ll wait for you and
we’ll find Andy.”</p>

<p>The little trainer wasn’t far to seek when
Gerald had dressed himself. He was in the office
upstairs. Arthur stayed outside while Gerald
stated his case.</p>

<p>“And you kept to the road, you say?” asked
the trainer.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, Andy; and Groom knows it, only
he won’t say so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see him. Don’t you bother; it’ll be
all right; be aisy in your mind, me bye.”</p>

<p>“Shall I see Mr. Bendix?” Gerald asked.</p>

<p>“No, no, I’ll tell him all about it. Maybe he
won’t have anything to do with it anyway. Sure,
I don’t see why I can’t settle the trouble meself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald joined Arthur and they made their way
across the Yard together. As they approached
the back of Whitson Hall a boy at an open window
in the second story hailed them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gerald! Come on up. Say, Arthur,
I want you to help me with this history stuff. Will
you?”</p>

<p>“That’s what comes of having a kid for a
roommate,” sighed Arthur. “He doesn’t try to
learn anything. All he thinks of is his beastly
stamp book. He’s driving me crazy, talking about
‘issues’ and ‘perforations,’ and all the rest of the
truck.”</p>

<p>“Are you coming right up?” called the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, and when I do I’ll wring your
young neck,” answered Arthur savagely. “Why
don’t you study once in a while?”</p>

<p>“How’s the stamp collection getting on,
Harry?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Fine!” replied Harry Merrow. “I got some
dandies the other day. Traded for them with
‘Tiger’ Smith. Come up and see them.”</p>

<p>“Some other time, Harry. You’re going to
study now, you know.” Harry Merrow made a
face.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of studying?” he demanded
pertly. “Arthur always help me out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he’s going to stop it right now!” declared
Arthur. “And, what’s more, I’m going to
pitch that stamp book out of the window if you
don’t forget it for a while. See you later, Gerald.
Don’t you worry about that; it’ll be all right.
Everyone knows Jake Hiltz.”</p>

<p>Arthur ran up the steps and disappeared into
Whitson Hall and Gerald went on to the next dormitory,
Clarke, and climbed two well-worn flights
of stairs. The last door in the corridor bore the
number 28 and two visiting cards tacked beneath
it. On one was “Daniel Morse Vinton,” and on
the other “Gerald Pennimore,” but it was much
too dark to read them. Gerald opened the door
and passed through. At the end of the room, on
the window seat, Dan and Alf were lolling.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Alf. “Behold the fleet-footed
Mercury!”</p>

<p>“Fleet-footed perhaps,” said Dan, “but not
glad-visaged. What’s the matter, Gerald? Anyone
dead?”</p>

<p>“Matter enough,” answered Gerald, as he
tossed his cap onto the table and threw himself
into the Morris chair. “Jake Hiltz has told everyone
that I cut the course this morning. He’s told
Ryan and wants him to disqualify me.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled Dan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Hiltz!” said Alf contemptuously. “Don’t
let that worry you, kid. Hiltz couldn’t tell the
truth if he was paid double.”</p>

<p>“And Groom was just ahead of us all the time,
and he knows I didn’t cut and he won’t say so,”
wailed Gerald.</p>

<p>“Groom never says anything if he can help it,”
responded Alf. “Andy will fix it all right; he’s
nobody’s fool. And he knows Jake, too. Has he
got any—er—foundation for his malicious libel,
Gerald? Did you wander away from the beaten
path, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Not once,” replied Gerald indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t suppose you had, unless by accident,”
said Alf soothingly. “I suppose Jake got
mad because you beat him at the finish and made
up the yarn out of whole cloth. I wouldn’t pay
any attention to it, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“But it’s all over school!”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Your word is as good as
Jake’s; better, for that matter; fellows will know
what to believe. Did you—er—encounter the gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was in the gym. I told him he was a
liar.”</p>

<p>“The dickens you did! And what did he say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. He tried to hit me, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Arthur Thompson got in the way, and after that
Durfee came along.”</p>

<p>“Durfee always was a kill-sport,” grieved Alf.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Alf,” said Dan. “Gerald hadn’t any
business getting fresh.”</p>

<p>“Well, why did he lie about me, then?” Gerald
demanded.</p>

<p>“When you’ve been in school longer, Gerald,
you’ll learn that you’ve got to put up with a lot of
lies. Lies don’t hurt any—as long as they <em>are</em>
lies.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t afraid of him, and if——”</p>

<p>“You’d have gone and had a mix-up in the
gym and got into a lot of trouble,” interrupted
Dan severely. “It’s a good thing Thompson or
Durfee, or whoever it was, interfered.”</p>

<p>“Think of Arthur Thompson jumping in and
saving our young hero!” chuckled Alf. “Why,
last year Gerald was training to fight him to a
finish. Gerald, I’ll bet you could get the best of
Jake Hiltz; he doesn’t know a thing about boxing.”</p>

<p>“Well, Gerald isn’t going to fight Hiltz,” said
Dan warmly. “And I wish you’d quit putting
fool ideas into his head, Alf.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma! Thank you, mamma. I consider
myself reproved and slapped twice on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wrist. Come on to dinner and stop worrying, Gerald.
It’ll all come out in the wash. And Dan’s
right, too. After you’ve been here a little longer
you’ll find that a fellow’s got to put up with a lot
of fool yarns. Just as long as you play fair you
don’t have to worry about what fellows say. Come
on now; this is roast-beef day, and I’m as hungry
as a bear!”</p>

<p>Yardley Hall School is at Wissining, Conn.,
and Wissining—for it is no use looking at your
map unless it is a very detailed one—is on Long
Island Sound, about halfway between New Haven
and Newport. It may be that you know all
about Yardley, in which case this chapter is not
for you, and you have only to pass it over, and
no hard feelings. I might take it for granted that
everyone knows Yardley, just as they know Exeter
and Andover and Groton and St. Mark’s and
Lawrenceville and Hillton and a dozen more. But
if I did I’d probably hear from it, for there is
always some one who “doesn’t know.” I once
heard a middle-aged gentleman, who sat across
from me in the parlor car, remark as the train
stopped at New Haven: “New Haven? There’s
some sort of an educational establishment for
boys here, isn’t there?” So, perhaps, there are
those who, when the train runs through Wissining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
observe the cluster of buildings on the hilltop
without knowing that they are looking at Yardley
Hall School.</p>

<p>Yardley is not very old, as New England
schools go, having been established no longer ago
than 1870. It was Oxford School for Young Gentlemen
in those days, and the buildings were but
two in number. The founder and head master,
Dr. Tobias Hewitt, an Englishman and a graduate
of Oxford University, managed for a quarter of
a century to conduct the school with credit and
pecuniary success. Then for some reason the enrollment
dwindled and the institution, which by
this time boasted four buildings, passed into the
hands of a stock company. Then came changes.
Oxford School became Yardley Hall School, the
forms became classes, the masters instructors.
More buildings were erected and a great deal of
money spent. Doctor Hewitt retained an interest
and remained Principal. Nowadays Yardley is
one of the finest preparatory schools in the country.
If you doubt my word you have only to ask
a Yardley student or graduate. The property
comprises some forty acres of hill and meadow
and woodland that runs from the shore of the
sound back a good three quarters of a mile to the
Wissining River, that little sluggish inconsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
stream that divides Wissining from her more citified
neighbor, Greenburg.</p>

<p>There are four dormitories, Whitson, Clarke,
Dudley, and Merle, Oxford Hall, containing the
offices, the Principal’s apartments, recitation
rooms, laboratories, library, assembly hall and society
headquarters, and the Kingdon Gymnasium,
one of the best appointed in the land. These
buildings, with the exception of Dudley, describe
roughly a half circle around the face of the hill,
with Oxford, the oldest and least attractive, in the
center. In front of Oxford is a terrace called The
Prospect, from which a wide view of sea and land
may be had. Dudley Hall, the senior dormitory,
is more retiring and stands back from the other
buildings, across the Yard. Southward the
ground slopes abruptly to the railroad cut,
through which the main-line trains dash and long
freights crawl day and night. There is a rustic
bridge here, and if you keep on the paths lead you
through a dense, well-kept woods to the beach
and the sound. Northward the land slopes more
gradually to the river and the tennis courts, athletic
field and boathouse. Eastward lies the golf
links with its puzzling nine-hole course. The river
twists and winds north-eastward, and divides to
make room for two tiny islands. Across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
stream lies Meeker’s Marsh, with Marsh Lake hidden
behind alder and swamp willow and rushes.
Here is the home of plover and snipe and duck,
and, truth compels me to add, mosquitoes.</p>

<p>There are five classes at Yardley: Preparatory,
Fourth, Third, Second, and First. The
Preparatory Class fellows room in Merle, under
the matronly care of Mrs. Ponder, popularly
known as “Emily,” and allude to themselves as
“preps.” First Class men call themselves seniors,
and, with the Second Class, constitute the Upper
Classmen. There are some two hundred and seventy
students in Yardley, their ages ranging from
twelve to twenty. Yardley sends most of her
product to Yale, while Broadwood Academy, her
dearest foe, supplies each year a fair proportion
of the entering class at Princeton. Broadwood
is situated some three miles inland from Greenburg,
and at Yardley they like to speak of it
maliciously as a “fresh-water school.” Yardley
and Broadwood are old-time rivals, meeting each
year on the gridiron, diamond, track, and rink.
For the glory of Yardley let me say that the Dark
Blue has triumphed more often than the green
of Broadwood, although there are pages of history
relating to dual contest which Yardley fellows
skim hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I’ve got that other verse,” announced Dan,
tossing his pencil aside and leaning back in his
chair.</p>

<p>“I wondered what awful deed you were doing,”
said Alf. “Let’s hear it.”</p>

<p>They were in 7 Dudley, a cozy, comfortable
room on the first floor of the dormitory. The
hosts, Alf and Tom, were stretched out on the
window seat, their legs apparently inextricably
mixed. Dan was seated at the table where, for the
past ten minutes, he had been scribbling and erasing.
Supper had been over for an hour and they
had discussed the events of the day to their
hearts’ content. The football game with St. John’s
had been played and won in two fifteen-minute
halves and each of the three was comfortably
weary and happy. The contest had not been a
hard one, but the weather had been warm and, to
use Tom’s expression, had “taken the starch out
of a fellow.” The score, 11 to 0, wasn’t anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to boast of, and there had been discouraging
features, but it was over with now and there was
no more practice until Monday afternoon and this
was no time to worry. Tom stretched his arms
with a sigh of lazy contentment, kicked Alf in the
shins, apologized sleepily and waited for Dan to
read his effusion. Dan held the sheet to the light,
frowned and hesitated.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it’s quite as good as the other
one,” he said apologetically.</p>

<p>“Who said the other was good?” asked Alf.</p>

<p>“You did.”</p>

<p>“Shut up and let him read it,” growled Tom.
“Go ahead, Dan.”</p>

<p>“We-ell, here it is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘All together! Cheer on cheer!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Victory is ours to-day!<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Yardley pluck has won the fray!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Flaunt the blue that never pales,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Tom. “What’s the
matter with it?”</p>

<p>“What are foeman quails?” asked Alf. “Besides,
the plural of quail is quail and not quails.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go to thunder!”</p>

<p>“And there’s another thing, Dan. I don’t just
like that line about lifting our voices. It suggests
exertion. Now, I might lift my voice without much
trouble, but just imagine Tom trying to lift that
heavy croak of his! He’d break his back at it!
Why don’t you——”</p>

<p>“You’re an idiot,” said Dan good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Let’s sing it,” suggested Alf. “How’s the
tune go? That’s it! All together, now!”</p>

<p>They sang it several times, until they had
learned the words, much to the distress of neighbors
who protested with groans and howls. Then
they sang both verses.</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty good song,” announced Tom
at last, pausing for breath. “It’s better than anything
we’ve had. You ought to get somebody to
write down the tune, though, before Alf changes
it entirely. Can you do it, Dan?”</p>

<p>“No, I wish I could.”</p>

<p>“Take it to Paul Rand,” said Alf. “He’s a
regular dabster at music. The only criticism I
have to make, Dan, is that your verses lack ginger.
You’ve got some awfully fine words in them, but
they’re—well, sort of flabby. I’ll bet I could write
a verse to that song that would wake you up a bit.
Who’s got a pencil?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat up and disentangled his legs.</p>

<p>“Lie down,” protested Tom. “Hide the pencils,
Dan.”</p>

<p>But Alf went over to the table and dumped
Dan out of his seat.</p>

<p>“Everyone very quiet now, please, while the
muse gets busy. I feel the spell coming on.”</p>

<p>Dan retired to the window seat, where he and
Tom uttered gibes while Alf’s pencil scratched on
the paper.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he remind you of Tennyson—not?”
inquired Tom.</p>

<p>“Looks to me more like Milton,” Dan opined
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that was a dandy line! Alf, you
aren’t holding your mouth quite right. A little
more curl on the left, please.”</p>

<p>“Bright and sparkling, showing the teeth,” advised
Dan.</p>

<p>But Alf wrote on, supremely indifferent to
interruptions, and at last dropped his pencil with
a smile of triumph.</p>

<p>“Just you listen to this!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Go head,” said Tom, “but please wave
your hand when you come to a rhyme so we’ll
know it.”</p>

<p>“Subside, brute! Listen:</p>

</div></div>

<p>“Now, that’s something like, isn’t it? Has go
and ginger to it, what?”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” laughed Dan. “Such pretty
thoughts!”</p>

<p>“Just full of quaint and cheerful sentiments!”
said Tom. “Sounds like an automobile
accident.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have that for the third verse,” said Alf,
grinning. “But I must have credit for it. ‘First
two verses by Dan Vinton; last verse by Alf Loring;
all rights reserved.’”</p>

<p>“‘Copyrighted in New Jersey and all foreign
countries,’” added Dan. “Why don’t you send
that to the <cite>Scholiast</cite>, Alf. It’s better than most
of the poetry they print.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think myself,” responded Alf modestly,
“that it has more feeling and delicacy. Say,
where’s Little Geraldine to-night?”</p>

<p>“With Arthur Thompson, I guess,” answered
Dan. “They’re getting pretty thick these days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“You guess!” said Alf severely. “What sort
of a guardian are you, I’d like to know. What do
you suppose John T. Pennimore would say if he
knew that you had let the child out of your sight
without being certain where he is?”</p>

<p>“Is he still worried about this morning?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I think so, but I tell him that no one will
believe Hiltz.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Alf, squeezing himself
onto the seat between them, “I’ve found out that
Hiltz is expecting to get on the Second Class Admission
Committee again, he and Thompson both.
Of course we don’t have to worry about Thompson,
but if we want to get Gerald into Cambridge
this year it’s up to you, Dan, to beat Hiltz out for
the committee.”</p>

<p>“What’ll I have to do?”</p>

<p>“Just let the fellows in the Second know that
you’re after the place, that’s all. It’s simple
enough, and you ought not have much trouble
beating Jake Hiltz. If you don’t, though, he will
blackball Gerald as sure as anything, especially
after what happened to-day, and, as you know,
one blackball will keep him out. And after that
there’s nothing left for him but an ignominious
admission to Oxford.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom, the only Oxford Society man of the three,
grunted sarcastically.</p>

<p>“All right,” Dan agreed. “I’ll start my campaign.
I suppose the thing to do is to see all the
fellows I know and get them to promise to vote for
me. When does the election come off?”</p>

<p>“Well, the classes elect committee members
about the first of November; I don’t know just
what the date is, but we can find out. Then the
society election comes off the first Wednesday
after the second Monday in the new moon, or
something idiotic like that; anyhow, it’s about the
twenty-third of November. Let’s go over to Cambridge
and find out all about it. Besides, there’ll
be a lot of fellows there and you can get in your
work.”</p>

<p>“All right. Better come along, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I’m particular where I go,” muttered
Tom sleepily. Alf threw a book at him playfully
and escaped before Tom could make
reprisal.</p>

<p>Secret societies are tabooed at Yardley, although
now and again one gets hints of mysterious
meetings behind draped transoms at dead o’
night. But both faculty and undergraduate sentiment
is opposed to such things and they soon die
of inanition. The two recognized societies are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Cambridge and Oxford. They are both debating
clubs, although of recent years they have become
rather more social than anything else. At one
time or another every student has the opportunity
to join one or other of the societies, but to be invited
to each is considered something of an honor.
This had happened to Gerald Pennimore the preceding
spring, when Alf and Dan had tried to
get him into Cambridge, and Tom, supported
by a handful of influential friends, had offered
Gerald the hospitality of Oxford. Gerald had
chosen Cambridge, but thanks to Jacob Hiltz,
then one of the two Third Class members of the
Admission Committee, he had received one blackball,
sufficient to bar him out. Dan and Alf
had thereupon made up their minds to secure
Gerald’s election this fall, and in order to do
that it was necessary to defeat Hiltz for the
Admission Committee, and Dan had agreed to run
against him.</p>

<p>The rooms of the rival societies were on the
top floor of Oxford Hall. Each was large and
comfortably furnished, with plenty of cushioned
window seats and easy chairs, tables for writing
and good reference libraries. Many fellows made
use of the rooms during the day to study in between
recitations, while in the evenings they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pretty certain to be well filled with members reading
or playing chess, checkers, dominoes, or cards.
To-night, when Dan and Alf entered Cambridge,
the weekly debate had just been finished and the
thirty or forty fellows present were moving their
chairs back against the walls, preparatory to social
diversions. A few minutes later they had
formed a group in a corner of the room with Paul
Rand and Joe Chambers. Both were seniors and
prominent in Cambridge affairs, Chambers being
president and Rand secretary. Chambers was
editor-in-chief of the school weekly, the <cite>Scholiast</cite>,
while Rand was manager of the basket-ball team.
Chambers soon supplied the information they desired
as to election dates.</p>

<p>“Dan’s a candidate for the Second Class
Admission Committee,” explained Alf. “By the
way, who are the members in your class,
Paul?”</p>

<p>“Derrick and I,” answered Rand.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then. We want to get young
Pennimore in next month. You haven’t anything
against him, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“And how about you, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Same here,” replied Chambers. He was a
tall, intellectual-looking youth who wore glasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and was popularly believed to be an embryo great
journalist.</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Alf. “You’d better get
busy, Dan, and hunt up some of your class fellows
and get them pledged. There’s Walpole over
there; tackle him.”</p>

<p>But Walpole was very sorry and had just
promised Hiltz to vote for him. “Wish I had
known before, Dan,” he said. “I’d rather stood
for you if you’d told me. I didn’t know you were
running.”</p>

<p>It didn’t take Dan long to discover that Hiltz
had been busy, for everyone of the dozen or so
Second Classmen he spoke to had been approached
by his adversary. A few only had not
definitely promised their support and these willingly
pledged their votes to Dan. Dan went back
to the group in the corner.</p>

<p>“Say, Paul, how many Second Class fellows
are there in Cambridge?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you in a minute.” Rand went to
his desk, unlocked a drawer and looked over the
membership list. “Twenty-nine,” he announced,
returning with the list in his hand. “Want to get
the names?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dan, “that’s a bully idea. Read
them out to me, will you?” So Paul read and Dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
jotted them down on a piece of paper. When he
had finished he said: “I’ve seen eleven to-night
and seven of them are promised to Hiltz. If that
ratio works out with the rest I’ll get only about
ten votes.” He looked doubtfully at Alf.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Hiltz has seen them all,” answered
Alf. “What you want to do is to get busy
right away. There’s Thompson now. Talk to
him, Dan.”</p>

<p>Arthur Thompson had just entered with Gerald
in tow and Dan crossed over to them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Thompson, I want to speak to you a
minute. This is your first visit this year, isn’t it,
Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Arthur invited me up. Is the debate
over?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ten minutes ago. Alf’s over there in the
corner, with Paul and Joe Chambers. I want to
speak to Thompson just a second.”</p>

<p>Gerald wandered away toward the group and
Dan plunged into his subject.</p>

<p>“I say, Thompson, you’re up for Admission
Committee, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you don’t vote for yourself,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” laughed Arthur. “It’s customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to vote for the other candidate and he votes for
you. It amounts to the same thing, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Any objection to voting for me?”</p>

<p>“You? You’re not up, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m up to beat Jake Hiltz. We want
to get Gerald through this time and Hiltz will
down him as sure as fate. He did last spring, you
know, and he’s bound to now after what happened
this morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. All right, I’ll vote for you, Vinton.
But I’m mighty afraid that Hiltz has the
thing cinched. I’d withdraw and give you my
votes, but that wouldn’t defeat Hiltz. I wish it
would. But I’ll help you all I can.”</p>

<p>“Will you? Then just look at this list and see
what fellows you think you can influence.”</p>

<p>Arthur looked it over. Then he took out his
pen and copied half a dozen of the names on the
back of an envelope. “I’ll look after these,” he
said in a businesslike way, “the first thing in the
morning. Is Jake here to-night?”</p>

<p>“He was before the debate, but he’s gone.
Maybe he’s canvassing now. I wonder——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I wonder why he’s so anxious to be reëlected,
Thompson.”</p>

<p>“That’s so! He hasn’t said a thing about it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
me. It looks as though he had just started in to-day,
doesn’t it? Do you suppose——”</p>

<p>“That he wants to get back so as to defeat
Gerald again? I wouldn’t be a bit surprised. It
certainly looks that way. I’ve spoken to eleven
fellows here this evening and they all said that
Hiltz had been after them before the debate.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s just what he’s up to, Vinton!
You heard about the protest he made against
Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Yes; just one of his lies, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gerald doesn’t cheat. And I guess he
knows that Ryan isn’t likely to believe him and
thinks he will get revenge in this way. Well, we’ll
do our best to beat him, Vinton. But we’ve got to
look sharp. He’s pretty foxy, Jake is.”</p>

<p>“And he’s got seven fellows pledged to him
already,” said Dan frowningly.</p>

<p>“How about you?” asked Arthur.</p>

<p>“Five, counting you.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so bad! I’ll come around to-morrow
after I’ve seen some of these chaps and let
you know what I’ve done. You’ll have to have fifteen
votes, won’t you? Well, there’s three on this
list that I’m sure you can count on, and that makes
eight. And if Jake hasn’t got ahead of us the
other seven won’t be hard to find.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but I’m awfully afraid he has,” said Dan
gloomily.</p>

<p>“We’ll know in the morning,” answered Arthur
cheerfully. “I’ll drop around to your room
in the afternoon, probably. So long.”</p>

<small>DAN BUYS A TICKET</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next day was Sunday and there was
church in the village in the forenoon and a big
dinner afterwards, and at two o’clock Dan and
Gerald were sprawled out in 28 Clarke, making a
not very convincing pretense at studying when
Arthur Thompson called. He glanced doubtfully
at Gerald as he found a seat.</p>

<p>“Want him to hear?” he asked. Dan nodded.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter, I guess. What luck did
you have?”</p>

<p>Thompson drew a list from his pocket and
tossed it over.</p>

<p>“The ones with crosses opposite are sure,” he
explained, “and those with circles are doubtful.
The rest are promised to Jake.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind going out, if you like,” said
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” answered Dan. “Stay where
you are. It’s only about the election of the Second
Class Admission Committee. I’ve decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
run with Thompson, that’s all.” He studied the
list in his hand.</p>

<p>“Well, you did better than I did, Thompson,”
he said finally. “I saw six fellows before church
and got only two. You’ve got three.”</p>

<p>“And two doubtful.”</p>

<p>“How doubtful?”</p>

<p>“Well, Murdock says he has half promised but
will vote for you if Jake will let him off, and
Simms said he doesn’t care who’s elected, but
thinks Jake ought to have it again if he wants it.
I told him you were the better man of the two and
he said he guessed that was so and would think it
over.”</p>

<p>Dan shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Simms doesn’t like me and you can count him
out. Well, I’ve still got three fellows to see;
couldn’t find them this morning. One of them,
Brewster, has gone home; has quinsy or tonsilitis
or something.”</p>

<p>“So I heard. He will be back this week,
though, I guess. And the election is two weeks
away. Maybe we can find the rest of the votes in
that time. How many more do we need, Vinton?”</p>

<p>“Five; we’ve got ten and have to have fifteen.”</p>

<p>“I think you can count on Murdock, and that
makes eleven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“That leaves four and only three fellows to
get them from. Some one will have to vote twice.”
Dan smiled as he handed back the list.</p>

<p>“Who are the two besides Brewster?” Arthur
asked.</p>

<p>“Hammel and Lowd.”</p>

<p>Arthur shook his head. “Hammel may be all
right; I don’t know much about him; but Caspar
Lowd is a particular friend of Hiltz.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t now,” said Gerald, looking up from
his book. “They had some sort of a row last
spring.”</p>

<p>“That so? Well, if you can get those two,
Vinton, you’ll be short only one vote; and that
may just come by accident; or some fellow may
change his mind before election.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the only hope,” said Dan. “Do
you know Brewster?”</p>

<p>“Only to speak to.”</p>

<p>“That’s about the limit of my acquaintance.
But I guess it doesn’t matter. I’m going to get
his home address from the office and write to him
this evening.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good scheme. And I wouldn’t wait
too long, for Jake may think of the same thing.
As the motto says, ‘Do it now!’”</p>

<p>“I will.” Dan laid his book down, pulled himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
out of his chair and reached for his cap.
“Want to walk over that way? I’ll be back in a
minute, chum.”</p>

<p>Gerald nodded and Dan and Arthur went out
and made their way across to Oxford. They found
Mr. Forisher, the secretary, at his desk and Dan
made his request. The secretary laid his pen
down and swung around in his swivel chair to the
card catalogue behind him.</p>

<p>“Brewster must be getting very popular,” he
remarked dryly. “This is the second time within
an hour I’ve been asked for his address.” Dan
and Arthur exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Who asked before, sir?” Dan questioned.
“Was it Hiltz?”</p>

<p>“Hiltz, yes. Well, the address is— Here, I’ll
write it down for you.” He did so and Dan took
it, thanked him and hurried out.</p>

<p>“When does the first mail go East, Arthur?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I guess on the afternoon
train. If you write that now and take it down to
the station and post it on the train——”</p>

<p>“Just what I mean to do. No use going to the
room; I’ll write it in the library. Come on.”</p>

<p>The library was deserted, save for two preparatory
youngsters who were whispering and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
giggling together in a corner and an older boy
who was seated at one of the broad tables writing.
Arthur pressed Dan’s arm.</p>

<p>“There he is now,” he whispered. Hiltz hadn’t
heard or seen them and they retreated quickly and
noiselessly.</p>

<p>“He’s writing to Brewster this minute,” murmured
Arthur, when they were back in the dim
corridor. “You run over to my room and write
the letter and I’ll stay here and see what Jake
does with his. If he posts it in the box at the door
you’ll have half a day on him, for they don’t collect
from there until six to-night.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Dan. “Got paper and
envelopes there?”</p>

<p>“In the left-hand drawer. Merrow’s there;
make him show you.”</p>

<p>Dan hurried off to Arthur’s room in Whitson.
Harry Merrow was not in, but he had no trouble
finding writing materials and soon had his brief
letter written. As he returned around the corner
of Oxford Arthur and Jake Hiltz sauntered out
of the building together and Hiltz crossed the
steps, raised the lid of the letter box and deposited
his letter. Dan smiled. The two came down the
steps and Dan nodded as he reached them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hiltz,” he said. “Hello, Thompson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Hiltz returned his greeting affably, for he
liked to stand in with the fellows of prominence,
and Thompson asked Dan where he was going.</p>

<p>“Just for a walk. Want to come along?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you don’t go too fast. I ate too much
dinner. So long, Jake.”</p>

<p>Hiltz had evidently intended joining them, but
Arthur’s dismissal changed his mind. “So long,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>Dan and Arthur descended The Prospect and
when out of earshot Dan asked:</p>

<p>“Did you see the letter?”</p>

<p>“Yep; it was for Brewster all right.”</p>

<p>“Then this is where we get ahead of him,”
chuckled Dan. “What time does that train go
through?”</p>

<p>“About a quarter past three, I think. By
Jove, though!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We’re a couple of idiots! It doesn’t stop
unless there’s some one to get off or on! I’d forgotten
that.”</p>

<p>“So had I,” answered Dan glumly. “When’s
the next one?”</p>

<p>“Not until evening, I guess, and that’s the one
Jake’s letter will go on. Smart, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Got any money on you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“About a dollar; why?”</p>

<p>“Lend it to me until we get back, will you?”</p>

<p>“Of course, but what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Buy a ticket to New York,” answered Dan
grimly.</p>

<p>“To New York! But you don’t want to go to
New York!”</p>

<p>“I want to stop that train, though. I’ll buy a
ticket and they’ll flag the train. You take the letter
and post it in the slot on the mail car. Then
I’ll decide to postpone my trip.” Dan laughed at
Arthur’s expression of admiring awe.</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder! I’d never have thought of
that! But won’t they be peeved?”</p>

<p>“Let them. I’ve got a perfect right to buy a
ticket and have the train stopped. If I change my
mind about going at the last minute it’s no one’s
business but mine. What time is it, I wonder.”
He glanced at his watch. “Let’s hit it up a bit,
Thompson. I’d hate to lose the train!”</p>

<p>Thompson laughed enjoyably. “Gee, I
wouldn’t have missed this for a farm!” he said.
“Can’t you just see the conductor’s face when you
don’t get on the train?”</p>

<p>The little station was empty when they
reached it save for the presence of the agent who,
tilted back in his chair at the telegraph desk at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the open window, was yawning behind his Sunday
newspaper.</p>

<p>“Does the express that comes along about
three-fifteen stop here?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the agent, glancing up briefly,
“not unless there’s some one to get on or off.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then. I’d like a ticket for
New York, please.” The agent glanced at the
clock and laid down his paper. It almost exhausted
the combined resources of the two boys
to pay for the ticket, but they managed it and had
a little to spare.</p>

<p>“Any baggage?” asked the agent. Dan told
him no, and they followed him out and watched
him set the signal. The next moment the train
whistled across the river at Greenburg and when
the agent came back along the platform Dan and
Arthur were bidding each other an affecting and
almost tearful good-by.</p>

<p>“You drop me a line, Thompson,” begged Dan,
“and tell me how everything’s going. Take good
care of Jake and the faculty, won’t you? And see
that Kilts wears his goloshes when it’s damp.”</p>

<p>“Look after yourself, Vinton,” begged Arthur.
“You’d better wire me from the city, so I’ll
know you’re all right and won’t worry.”</p>

<p>“I will. Good-by!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-by, old man, good-by. Do be careful
of yourself and watch out for automobiles at the
crossings.”</p>

<p>“I will. And you be good to the faculty while
I’m gone. See that Noah gets his warm milk every
morning. My love to Old Toby. Good-by!”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Vinton.” They wrung each other’s
hands and dashed a few unmanly tears from their
eyes as the big locomotive charged clanging down
upon them with brakes set and rasping. Arthur
hurried after it up the platform with the letter in
his hand. The vestibule doors swung open and
the porters leaned inquiringly out as the train
stopped.</p>

<p>“Express for New Haven, Bridgeport, Stamford,
and New York!” called the conductor. “All
aboard!”</p>

<p>Dan, hands in pocket, surveyed the conductor
with a thoughtful frown.</p>

<p>“Who’s going? You, sir?” The conductor
glanced impatiently from the agent to Dan. The
agent hurried across the platform.</p>

<p>“This is your train, boy! Hurry up and get
on.”</p>

<p>Dan shook his head slowly. Up the platform
Arthur was sauntering back with a broad smile
on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#i_fp056">“I guess I won’t go, thanks,” said Dan.</a> “I’ve
just remembered that I didn’t bring my pyjamas.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_57">“‘I guess I won’t go, thanks,’ said Dan.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” The conductor glared at the agent.
“What did you set that signal for?”</p>

<p>“He bought a ticket,” answered the agent aggrievedly,
“and said he wanted to go to New
York.”</p>

<p>The conductor sprang up the steps, waving his
hand to the impatient engineer.</p>

<p>“The next time,” he called crossly, “you’d better
decide what you want to do! This isn’t a trolley
car! All right!” The vestibule doors slammed
shut and in another moment the express was entering
the cut, the last car flirting by in a cloud of
dust with an insulted air.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice one,” charged the agent.
“Thought you wanted to go to New York. Want
to get me in trouble, do you?”</p>

<p>“I do want to go to New York,” answered Dan
earnestly. “I’d like nothing better. But when
I got to thinking it over I decided that I oughtn’t
to expect the school to get along without me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did!” said the agent suspiciously,
looking from Dan’s preternaturally sober countenance
to Arthur’s trembling mouth. “One of
your fool tricks, I suppose. I got a good mind to
report this to Doctor Hewitt, I have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see why you need be so impatient with
me,” complained Dan plaintively. “What difference
does it make whether I got on the train or
not? You ought to be glad that I’ve listened to
the voice of duty.”</p>

<p>“Yah!” muttered the agent, turning on his
heel and retiring to the station. Dan smiled
sweetly and winked at Arthur.</p>

<p>“Did you post it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“Good.” Dan drew his ticket to New York
from a pocket and observed it reflectively. “I
guess I won’t want this for a while,” he said.
“Guess the money will be more useful.” He followed
the agent inside and knocked on the window.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it now?” inquired the official
as he slammed the window up.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have you redeem this for me, if
you please, sir,” said Dan politely. The agent
glared from the ticket to Dan. Then he picked it
up and tossed it onto the table.</p>

<p>“All right. Come around in a couple of weeks
and you’ll get the money. But if you try any more
fool tricks like this on me I’ll go up to school and
report you!”</p>

<p>Down crashed the window. Dan viewed Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sorrowfully and led the way out of the station.
They laughed and chuckled over the episode
all the way back to school, and it was only when
they parted at the first entrance to Whitson that
Dan’s thoughts reverted to more serious matters.
Then:</p>

<p>“I guess Hiltz doesn’t know yet that I’m running
against him, Thompson. He was much too
pleasant to me.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m pretty sure he doesn’t. But he will
find out pretty soon; some of the fellows will tell
him. Then he <em>will</em> be mad!”</p>

<p>“I guess I can stand it,” replied Dan philosophically.
“Anyway, now that I’ve started this
thing I’m going to see it through. And I’m going
to win out if it’s anyhow possible, Hiltz or no
Hiltz!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>CONDUCTING A CAMPAIGN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On Monday Andy Ryan gave his decision regarding
Jake Hiltz’s protest of Gerald in the
cross-country trial. Both Hiltz and Gerald were
to be retained on the squad.</p>

<p>“That,” explained Andy, “will make thirteen
of you instead of twelve, and it ain’t likely that
either of you or Hiltz will get in the race with
Broadwood, but, of course, something might happen
to give you a chance. So you can train with
the team or not, just as you like.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep on,” said Gerald. “If I didn’t fellows
might think you believed Hiltz’s story and
had put me off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not worrying about what he said,”
confided Andy. “Maybe he thought you cut the
corner, but——”</p>

<p>“He knows very well I didn’t!” exclaimed
Gerald indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, well, it doesn’t matter,” said the trainer
soothingly. “I’ll keep you both. That gives us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
three substitutes, you and Hiltz and Groom. If
anything happens to one of the first ten, then one
of you boys will get your chance, and I’ll take the
one that shows up best between now and the race,
no matter how you finished Saturday.”</p>

<p>That seemed fair enough and Gerald couldn’t
object, although he had hoped for a vindication
from the trainer. The cross-country squad went
to a training table a few days later, for, although
the race with Broadwood was more than a month
distant, the school had set its heart on winning
and Andy meant that it should. There was a run
three afternoons a week for varying distances, although
it was not until a week before the final
contest that the team was sent over the full course.
Meanwhile relations between Jake Hiltz and Gerald
remained strained. It was embarrassing at
first, having to sit right across the table three
times a day from Hiltz, but Gerald soon got used
to it. For a while Hiltz never wasted an opportunity
to nag the younger boy, but the rest of the
squad soon got tired of it and came to Gerald’s
rescue and Hiltz gave it up. Besides, he had
plenty of other troubles by that time.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly angry with Dan for entering
the race for committeeman, and, while he was
pretty certain of reëlection, he didn’t neglect any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
chances. He never quite understood how Dan had
got ahead of him with Brewster, and when that
absent youth replied to his letter by informing
him that he had already pledged his vote to Vinton,
Hiltz was both astounded and angry. He had
always intended seeking reëlection, for the office
carried not a little honor with it, but Dan and Arthur
were correct in their surmise that it had been
his grudge against Gerald which had set him suddenly
to work securing pledges. He was quite certain
that Gerald would come up again for election
to Cambridge, and, since he had defeated him in
the spring when his dislike to the millionaire’s son
had been general rather than personal, he certainly
wasn’t going to let him get in now when he
detested him as much as he did. Besides Hiltz’s
dislike for Gerald there was also his dislike of
Gerald’s sponsors to egg him on. Hiltz envied
both Dan and Alf, just as he envied any fellow
who had secured honor and popularity denied him,
and with Hiltz envy was akin to hate. So, in a
way of speaking, he had three reasons for securing
reëlection to the Admission Committee and
keeping Gerald out of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The election of Admission Committees by the
First, Second, and Third Classes was to take
place on the first Wednesday in November.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Meanwhile Dan and Arthur Thompson were busy.
Hiltz had soon learned of Arthur’s defection and
had entered him in his bad books also. Murdock
had finally agreed to vote for Dan. Brewster, too,
was pledged, and Dan had at last persuaded Caspar
Lowd to promise him his vote. Therefore,
out of twenty-nine votes Dan was practically sure
of thirteen, two less than necessary to secure his
election.</p>

<p>“I know where you can get one vote,” said
Arthur, one day, less than a week before the election.</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Dan eagerly.</p>

<p>Arthur pointed his pencil at Dan. “Why, vote
for yourself,” he said. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because—” Dan hesitated. “Oh, I don’t
like the idea of it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You don’t suppose that Jake will
vote for you, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, not much. But, just the same— Besides,
I’d still be short a vote, Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you should find that other vote will
you agree to cast your own vote where it’ll do the
most good?”</p>

<p>“I’ll think it over,” answered Dan. “I don’t
suppose there’s any good reason why I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Of course there isn’t! It’s only a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
courtesy to vote for your opponent, and you certainly
don’t owe any courtesy to Jake Hiltz.”</p>

<p>“I’ll think about it; and I’ll ask Alf and Tom
what they think.”</p>

<p>“All right. If only we could get Hammel to
change his mind; or Simms.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want Simms’s vote,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, a vote’s a vote, isn’t it? Besides,
you haven’t anything against Simms, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, but I know pretty well that he doesn’t
like me, and so I don’t want him to vote for me.”</p>

<p>“Personal likes and dislikes,” quoth Arthur
oracularly, “shouldn’t enter into politics.”</p>

<p>“But I fancy they do a good deal,” laughed
Dan. “What time do the elections come off?”</p>

<p>“Three to three-fifteen in Oxford F. And
we’ve got to do some hustling that day and see
that our constituents get to the polls. Gee, if a
couple of Jake’s henchmen failed to show up in
time to vote it would help a lot, wouldn’t it? But
they won’t; Jake will be right after them. And
so must we be. I wonder if we ought to provide
carriages for our voters.”</p>

<p>“We might get Gerald to loan us his father’s
automobile,” laughed Dan. “It’s down there at
Sound View not doing a thing.”</p>

<p>“Say, that would make a hit, wouldn’t it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Maybe if we could tell some of Jake’s supporters
that if they voted for you they’d be taken from
their rooms to Oxford in an automobile, we could
land the election for you!”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the only way we can land it,”
said Dan dubiously. “I’m going to talk things
over with Alf. He was cut out for a politician.
Want to come along?”</p>

<p>“Can’t; I have to study a bit. I’ll look in to-morrow.
There goes Gerald. I wonder if he
knows what a mint of trouble you’re taking to get
him elected to Cambridge.”</p>

<p>“I fancy he suspects,” said Dan, with a smile.
“He isn’t a fool, Gerald isn’t. Well, see you to-morrow
then. So long, Arthur. Thanks for taking
so much trouble for me. I’ll try and do something
for you some day to make up.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, you don’t need to! I like it! I only
hope we succeed, that’s all.”</p>

<p>They got up from where they had been sitting
on the steps of Whitson and Arthur rattled upstairs
to his room while Dan went across the Yard
to Dudley. Alf’s and Tom’s room was on the
ground floor and so it wasn’t necessary to enter
the building in order to discover whether they
were at home. Dan simply put his head in at the
open window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anyone in?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, we’re both out,” replied Tom, from the
window seat, making a grab for Dan and just
missing. Dan looked carefully about the Yard
and then swung himself in through the casement,
trampling on Tom and bringing a groan of protest
from that recumbent youth.</p>

<p>“If faculty sees you do that,” remonstrated
Alf from the table, “you’ll get fits.”</p>

<p>“What faculty doesn’t see won’t hurt them,”
returned Dan. “What’s happened to your nose,
Alf?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen this before?” inquired Alf,
feeling gingerly of the strip of plaster that marred
the beauty of his countenance. “I got that yesterday
in practice. I think Tom handed it to me,
although he pretends he didn’t. All I know is that
he mistook me for the second once and tried to lay
me out.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t,” growled Tom. “You got mixed on
your signals, as per usual, and got in the way.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t broken, is it?” asked Dan anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, just gouged out a bit, and rather swelly.
What’s new?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I guess. But I wanted to ask you
fellows something.”</p>

<p>“You have come to the right place for knowledge,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
said Alf cheerfully. “We are the Oracle
Brothers.”</p>

<p>“Well, see here, would it be all right for me
to vote for myself next Wednesday?”</p>

<p>“If you can’t find a good candidate,” responded
Alf gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! I’m in earnest. I’m short two
votes as it stands now and Thompson says I ought
to agree to vote for myself if we can get hold of
another vote anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Of course you ought,” said Alf. “What
beastly nonsense! Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t done generally, is it?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes it isn’t, but I guess that’s only
when the candidate is sure of his election.”</p>

<p>“What do you think, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I say vote for whoever you want elected, no
matter whether it’s you or another chap. Your
vote’s as good as anyone’s and you might as well
have it. If I were you I’d vote for Thompson and
Vinton.”</p>

<p>“Honest?”</p>

<p>“Honest.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I will, then—that is, if I can
find the other vote. If I can’t it won’t matter who
I vote for.”</p>

<p>“Still shy one?” asked Alf. “Can’t you induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
any of Hiltz’s followers to change their
minds?”</p>

<p>“I think plenty of them would like to, but Hiltz
made them promise—cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die,
you know—that they’d vote for him. Naturally
they don’t like to break their promises.”</p>

<p>“Well, accidents have happened,” said Alf.
“Some fellow may forget to show up, or be sick,
or break a leg, or something on Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Jake will see that none of those things happen
to his voters. If any fellow breaks his leg I’ll
bet it will be one of mine.”</p>

<p>“One of your legs?”</p>

<p>“Voters, you idiot.”</p>

<p>“What time does the election come off?”
asked Tom, laying aside his book.</p>

<p>“Three to three-fifteen on Wednesday, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Polls close promptly at three-fifteen, do
they?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“You want to insist that they shall,” said Alf.
“Unless, of course, one of your voters is late.”</p>

<p>“Who are some of the fellows promised to
Hiltz?” continued Tom, looking dreamily out of
the window. Dan ran over a dozen of them and
Tom nodded now and then.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said finally, “I want you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
promise me something, Dan. Promise me to vote
for yourself whether you get that other vote or
not. Will you? You see, you can’t tell until the
count how many votes you’ve got, and you’d feel
pretty sore afterwards if you discovered that
you’d missed it by one vote that you might have
given yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Dan,” agreed Alf. “You’d better
do it anyway.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will.”</p>

<p>“And, Dan,” went on Tom sleepily as he took
up his book again, “let me know Wednesday
morning how things stand, will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“Just try and remember. I—I’m awfully
interested in school politics and—er—elections
and—” His voice died away. Dan smiled across
at Alf, but Alf was regarding Tom with a puzzled,
thoughtful expression on his face.</p>

<small>THE ELECTION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Room F was one of the larger recitation rooms
in Oxford, a rectangular, high-ceilinged apartment,
with tall windows along one side and a dismal
expanse of blackboard occupying most of the
remaining wall space. There were some thirty
seats, and a small platform at one end supported a
desk and chair. On Wednesday, at a few minutes
before three in the afternoon, Room F was well
filled and the corridor outside was noisy with the
sound of voices and the tramping of feet. The
First and Third Classes were holding or were
about to hold their elections in neighboring rooms,
and there was quite a little excitement in the air.
It was the Second Class election, however, that
aroused the most interest. Usually the elections
are cut-and-dried affairs, but Dan’s appearance in
the race had raised the contest out of the humdrum
level, and even Second Class fellows who
were not Cambridge members had caught the excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and were waiting in the corridors to
learn the result.</p>

<p>“First elects Rand and Derrick,” announced
Arthur Thompson, entering the room. “Isn’t it
time to start things here, fellows?”</p>

<p>“It’s only two minutes of three,” objected
Hiltz, who was doing a little final electioneering
over by the windows.</p>

<p>“Then your watch is slow,” retorted Arthur.
“First’s closed her polls and counted. What time
have you got, Lowd?”</p>

<p>“Three-four.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s get busy. Is Chambers here?”</p>

<p>“Here and waiting,” answered Joe. “Got
your slips ready?”</p>

<p>“They’re on the desk there, aren’t they? They
were there when I came in.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got them. Gentlemen, the polls are open.
Please write the names of two candidates and
your own name on the slips, fold, and then hand
them to me.”</p>

<p>The fellows crowded up for the slips of blank
paper and then retired to the seats to prepare
their ballots. Chambers took his seat at the desk
and laid the roster of voters’ names open in front
of him. As usual pencils and pens were scarce
and had to be handed around from one to another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Arthur sought Dan where the latter was filling out
his ballot on a window ledge.</p>

<p>“Are all your fellows here, Dan?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I think so. I thought I’d check them off from
Chambers’s list as they voted.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s the best. If they wouldn’t
keep moving around so we could check them off
now. Jake was trying to get Lowd back into the
fold awhile ago; did you notice? But I guess he
didn’t succeed, for I heard Lowd tell him to run
away!”</p>

<p>One by one the voters handed their folded slips
to Joe Chambers and gave their names. Joe laid
the ballots in an open drawer at his side and
crossed off the voter’s name on the roster, announcing
it aloud as he did so. Both Dan and
Arthur got their votes in early, and Hiltz was
only a minute behind them. Then the first two,
who had drawn apart to watch and confer, noticed
excitement in the Hiltz camp. Hiltz compared the
list he held with that on the desk, searched the
room with his gaze, talked vehemently with one
of his supporters, and finally dispatched that
youth on an errand.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s missing,” said Dan in low tones.
“What time is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ten after. They’ll have to hurry if they want
to get him.”</p>

<p>Hiltz was plainly nervous and anxious, passing
from the window to the door, disappearing in the
corridor and hurrying back again.</p>

<p>“Well, our fellows are all here,” said Arthur.
“Murdock is voting now, and he’s the last one.
Look at Hiltz, will you! I’m going to see who’s
missing.”</p>

<p>Arthur wormed his way through the group
about the desk and leaned over the list. While he
was gone a sandy-haired fellow approached Dan.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll win, Vinton,” he said. “It was
funny about that letter of yours. It came at about
eleven one morning, and then at three that afternoon
I got a letter from Hiltz asking me to vote for
him. I was glad yours came first, though, for I’d
rather you got it.”</p>

<p>“Why, thanks, Brewster,” answered Dan cordially.
“That was funny, though, wasn’t it? I’m
glad I got there first.”</p>

<p>“So’m I. Hope you beat him.” And Brewster
strolled away just as Arthur Thompson came back
with his eyes dancing with excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s that pill, Conover,” he said in a low voice.
“Everyone else has voted. And it’s fourteen minutes
past,” he added, glancing at his watch. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
he doesn’t come in the next minute you’ll win for
sure, Dan!”</p>

<p>“Jove!” muttered Dan, looking at his own timepiece.
“Say, do you mind asking to have the polls
closed as soon as time’s up? It will look better
coming from you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, don’t you worry.” Arthur kept his
eyes on the minute hand of his watch. Hiltz, surrounded
by three or four of his friends, was talking
angrily, and referring every few seconds to
the watch held in his hand.</p>

<p>“Three-fifteen, Chambers,” called Arthur, stepping
up to the desk. “Let’s start the count and
get through. Some of the fellows have got to report
for football in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Chambers looked at his own watch.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “Has everyone here
voted? Is Conover in the room?”</p>

<p>“He will be here in a minute,” called Hiltz. “It
isn’t a quarter past yet.”</p>

<p>“My watch says it is,” responded Chambers
mildly, “but——”</p>

<p>“So does mine,” interrupted Arthur. “It’s almost
sixteen after. The polls are supposed to
close at three-fifteen.”</p>

<p>“My watch says three-thirteen,” said Hiltz angrily,
“and I know that it is right. Besides, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
isn’t, you didn’t open the polls until four minutes
after three. You’ve got to allow fifteen minutes,
Chambers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess there’s no objection to that, is
there?” asked Chambers, glancing around.</p>

<p>But it seemed that there was much objection,
and things began to get noisy and disputatious
in Room F. And just when Chambers
was insisting on silence there was a knock on
the door.</p>

<p>“He’s come!” groaned Arthur.</p>

<p>But when the door opened it was only the messenger
that entered.</p>

<p>“Did you find him?” called Hiltz, hurrying
across the room. “Is he coming?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find him anywhere, Jake. I’ve been
all over the school!”</p>

<p>Hiltz glared a moment at the boy and then
turned on his heel and walked to the window,
and——</p>

<p>“Polls closed!” announced Chambers.</p>

<p>Arthur clapped Dan on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“You’ve won!” he whispered gleefully. But
Dan shook his head.</p>

<p>“Better wait and see. You can’t be sure
yet.”</p>

<p>The room quieted down while Chambers opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the ballots and tabulated the votes. It didn’t take
him long, and after he had been over the ballots a
second time, he rapped on the desk.</p>

<p>“Here’s the result, fellows. Quiet, please.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Thompson</span>, 26.<br />
<span class="smcap">Vinton</span>, 15.<br />
<span class="smcap">Hiltz</span>, 13.<br />
</p>

<p>“Thompson and Vinton are elected.”</p>

<p>Pandemonium broke loose for a minute, during
which Dan, striving to hide his satisfaction under
a quiet smile, was congratulated by friend and foe
alike. Only Hiltz kept away and, a moment later,
left the room, frowning darkly, perhaps in search
of the renegade Conover.</p>

<p>“Glad you won, Vinton,” was the remark of
several of Hiltz’s supporters. “I didn’t vote for
you, you know, because I’d given my word to Hiltz,
but I’m glad you beat.”</p>

<p>Then the room emptied and Dan and Arthur
followed the others out through the corridor,
where the news had already spread. Dan had
to stop many times to be shaken by the hand
or pounded on the back, but finally he was free
to hurry to the gymnasium and get into his
togs for afternoon practice. Arthur went with
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what I don’t see,” said Dan perplexedly,
“is how I got fifteen. I had only fourteen that I
knew of.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you,” answered Arthur. “The fifteenth
was Simms. He stopped me on the way out
a minute ago. ‘I concluded you were right,
Thompson,’ he said. ‘I don’t like Dan Vinton
much, but I guess he’s a heap better than Jake
Hiltz. So I voted your way.’”</p>

<p>“Simms! Well, I’m much obliged to him, although,
as it happened, I didn’t need his vote. I
wonder what became of Conover? I’d hate to be
in his shoes when Hiltz finds him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Conover’s a pill, anyway. He probably
forgot all about the election. For my part, I don’t
care what Jake does to him!”</p>

<p>The mystery of Conover’s disappearance was
explained later, however, when between the two
short practice halves Dan shared Tom’s blanket on
the side-line.</p>

<p>“They tell me you won, Dan,” said Tom. “Glad
to hear it; glad you licked Jake Hiltz. Close, was
it?”</p>

<p>“I got fifteen to his thirteen.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen! I thought you said you were sure of
only fourteen.”</p>

<p>“I did; and I was. But a fellow named Simms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
came over to me at the last moment.” Tom
chuckled.</p>

<p>“That’s a joke on me, then. Know a chap
with rusty hair and spectacles named Conover?”</p>

<p>“Only by sight. He was one of Hiltz’s fellows
and didn’t show up. I don’t know what happened
to him. Hiltz is crazy mad, I guess. He
sent a fellow out to hunt Conover up, but he
wasn’t to be found.”</p>

<p>“Guess they didn’t look in the right place,”
said Tom with a grin.</p>

<p>“Why? What do you know about it?”</p>

<p>“I know where Conover was from a quarter
past two to twenty minutes past three,” replied
Tom with a twinkle.</p>

<p>“You do? Where?”</p>

<p>“In Number 7 Dudley.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em> In your room? Look here, Tom,
what have you been up to?”</p>

<p>“Well, I <em>thought</em> I was up to helping you get
elected, but it seems that I might just as well have
spared myself the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you—you——”</p>

<p>Tom nodded.</p>

<p>“Exactly. I knew Conover was a chess fiend,
and so this morning, after you told me how you
stood, I called on him and invited him to play a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
game with me after dinner. He was pleased to
death. I let him have things his own way, of
course, and at three I told him that I hated to
spoil the game but that it was time for him to
go over and cast his vote. I guess he thought I
was trying to rattle him. Anyway, he said he
didn’t want to vote and wasn’t going to. So I
thought he knew his own mind, and didn’t say
any more about it. And then, at twenty after, I
started in and did him up. He can’t play chess
any more than—than Alf can!”</p>

<p>“Tom, you’re a wonder!” laughed Dan.
“That’s the best joke I’ve heard in a year. It
was mighty decent of you, though,” he continued
seriously, “and I appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I had my fun, too.”</p>

<p>“But, just the same, I’m rather glad I got
Simms’s vote, for I don’t think I’d have liked
being elected that way.”</p>

<p>Tom only grunted.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>AT SOUND VIEW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Pennimore’s return to Sound View was
delayed a week, and so it was after Dan’s success
at the election when Gerald was summoned
to the telephone in the school office one morning
and found his father at the other end of the line.
And it was three nights later that Dan and Tom
and Alf took dinner with Gerald and Mr. Pennimore.</p>

<p>The Steamship King was a rather small man
of fifty-four, with the face of a scholar rather
than of a successful financier and business man.
His black eyes were thoughtful and kindly, and
his dark hair was as yet only slightly grizzled
at the temples. The guests of the evening were
very fond of him, and their liking was returned.
Gerald’s mother had died when he was a few
months old, and he was the only child. Until
entering Yardley at the beginning of the second
term last year he had been all his life in the care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of governesses and tutors, with his father keeping
an anxious eye on him. The result was only
what might have been expected. He had been
coddled far too much and a trifle spoiled. But
Yardley had done him good. Mr. Pennimore acknowledged
that readily and had more than once
thanked Dan for having been the cause of Gerald’s
choice of that school. Even before his son’s
entrance there Mr. Pennimore had done a good
deal for the school, and now that Gerald swore
allegiance to the dark blue, he was ready and
anxious to do much more, and it was only half
a secret that when Gerald graduated there was
to be a new and very wonderful dormitory
erected to the left of Dudley Hall, and that
with the building was to go a generous donation
to be used for the general enlargement of the
school.</p>

<p>The Pennimore family consisted only of Mr.
Pennimore and Gerald, although the big house
was filled with servants. To-night the small
round table in the center of the big dining room
held a very merry quintet. The boys wore their
dinner jackets, and wore them with quite an air—all
save Tom; Tom looked and doubtless felt
very uncomfortable behind his starched shirt-bosom
and straining waistcoat. There was little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
formality at that dinner, for the boys had
adopted Mr. Pennimore as one of themselves, a
sort of honorary member of Yardley. Mr. Pennimore
had to be told all the news, and they each
took a hand in bringing history down to date for
his benefit. Alf’s account of the election amused
him vastly, and he looked across at Tom with a
twinkle in his black eyes.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he said, “you have the making of a
politician; I can see that. And I don’t know of
a better field for politics of the kind you displayed
the other day than your own home State
of New Jersey—with the possible exception of
Delaware and Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always thought,” remarked Alf, allowing
the butler to help him to a third slice of
chicken, “that Tom would make a dandy alderman.
I saw an alderman once and he looked just
like Tom—sort of big and lazy.”</p>

<p>“You wait till I get you outside,” growled
Tom.</p>

<p>“Now tell me about football,” said their host.
“I feel quite honored at having three gridiron
heroes at my table at once. Going to whip Broadwood
again this year?”</p>

<p>“You bet we are!” declared Gerald emphatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’d stand a better chance, sir,” said Tom,
“if we had a good quarter back and a good captain.”</p>

<p>“Eh? But I thought that—I thought Alf was—was—”
Mr. Pennimore looked about the table
bewilderedly, and Gerald broke into laughter.</p>

<p>“That’s just Tom’s joke, sir. Alf <em>is</em> captain
and quarter. And he’s a dandy, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.” Mr. Pennimore joined the laughter.
“I thought I wasn’t mistaken about it. And
you play end, don’t you, Dan? And Tom, here,
is——”</p>

<p>“Water carrier,” interrupted Alf pleasantly.
“Quite correct, sir. And one of the best we’ve
ever had—when he doesn’t go to sleep and fall
into the pail.”</p>

<p>“Tom’s right half back, sir,” said Gerald, “and
you mustn’t mind what they say about the team.
It’s a mighty good team, and it’s going to
lick spots out of Broadwood in just about two
weeks.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it, son. Has the team had
a good season so far, Alf?”</p>

<p>“Only fair, sir. We won from Greenburg,
Forrest Hill and St. John’s, tied Carrel’s and lost
to Porter and Brewer. The Brewer game ought
to have been ours, though. The referee gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a touchdown they didn’t make. The ball was dead
about twenty yards from our goal and a Brewer
half picked it up and ran over with it.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you—ah—protest?”</p>

<p>“Until I was black in the face,” replied Alf
disgustedly. “But it didn’t do any good. The
referee was a man they’d picked up somewhere
and he was punk. They say he’s a baseball umpire.
Maybe he is; he certainly isn’t a football
referee.”</p>

<p>“And who do you play Saturday?” asked Mr.
Pennimore.</p>

<p>“Nordham, sir. It’s our last game before we
tackle Broadwood.”</p>

<p>“And have they a good team this year?”</p>

<p>“One of the best ever, sir. They’ve got a fellow
named Warren—he was center for Princeton
last year—helping coach over there. They
say he’s a wonder.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dan, “we’ve got a Yale man
coming down to-morrow to help us. And Alf’s
brother is coming, too, for a couple of days.”</p>

<p>“If he can get away,” grumbled Alf. “He
makes me tired. He made all sorts of promises
last year and now he just squeals.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” remarked Tom, “I think
Broadwood’s going to give us fits this year. She’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
got a dandy team, good coaches and we have to
play her on her own grounds.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal in that,” agreed Dan.
“I mean in playing away from home.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will do the best we can,” said Alf
cheerfully. “I wonder if I might have some more
of the egg plant, sir?”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing we have to cheer us up,”
said Tom, “and that is that our captain is still
able to peck at a little food.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad he is,” replied Mr. Pennimore
with a smile. “And I’d like to see you and Dan
doing a little better. Have some more of the
chicken, won’t you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, thanks. I eat very little.”</p>

<p>Alf made a choking sound that indicated suppressed
laughter.</p>

<p>“Don’t take any more chicken,” advised Gerald.
“There’s a salad yet and then some dandy
ice cream. And I know you like ice cream, Tom.”</p>

<p>“It’s one of the few things I can relish,” answered
Tom with a grin. “I have a very delicate
stomach.”</p>

<p>“So has an ostrich,” jeered Alf.</p>

<p>“Another chap and I fed an ostrich on celluloid
campaign buttons once,” said Tom reminiscently.
“It was at the Zoo. We had our pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
full of Bryan buttons and the ostrich seemed to
like them tremendously. I guess he ate about
forty of ’em.”</p>

<p>“What happened to him?” asked Dan, laughingly.</p>

<p>“I never heard. I guess he became a Bryanite,
though.”</p>

<p>After dinner there was a comfortable hour in
the big library in front of the fire, for the evenings
were getting chilly those days, and then the
four boys said good night and piled themselves
into the automobile and were taken humming back
to school.</p>

<p>Yardley had little difficulty with the Nordham
Academy team on the following Saturday, sending
it down in defeat to the tune of 17 to 0 and
thereby earning consolation for what had happened
last year when Nordham, with a spry and
tricky team, had played her to a tie. Football
was in the air now. In fact, Yardley was obsessed
with athletics, for not only was the gridiron contest
with her hated rival imminent but there
was also the question of cross-country supremacy
to settle.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning Andy Ryan sent his
charges over the full course for the first time and,
although he never gave out the time, he was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
pleased. In that run Gerald, who had been doing
better at every trial, finished seventh among the
twelve who ran. (Garson was out of the team for
good with a torn leg muscle sustained in a class
football game.) Word filtered into Yardley that
Broadwood expected to make a clean sweep next
Saturday by winning both in the morning and
afternoon. But Yardley laughed scornfully and
held three football mass meetings and whooped
things up until the enthusiasm was deafening.
Cheers and songs were practiced and Dan’s contribution
made a great success. (Alf’s verse, by
the way, was not added.) Studies suffered a good
deal that last week and the faculty almost called
a mass meeting of its own to protest against the
students’ neglect of lessons. “Kilts,” whose real
name was Mr. McIntyre and who taught mathematics,
shook his head a lot those days and predicted
dire things when examination time arrived.
But sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof,
and just now the one thing in life was to witness
the double humiliation of the Green.</p>

<p>The Cross-Country Team had its last work on
Thursday when it was sent over half the course
at a little more than an amble, and the Eleven
held its last practice that afternoon. The Second
Team disbanded to the cheers of the students and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
went capering off the field, glad that their period
of hard work and hard knocks was at an end. The
First went through signal drill while the spectators
cheered them collectively and individually
and finally trotted away, leaving the field for the
last time that year. The next afternoon the football
team and the runners went for a sail on Mr.
Pennimore’s big steam yacht. It wasn’t an ideal
day for cruising about the sound, for there was
a cold east wind and a lowering sky, but the fellows
took along plenty of sweaters and blankets
and enjoyed it immensely. The deck of the <i>Princess</i>
looked like an Indian encampment with all
those blue-and-gray blankets dotted about. Mr.
Pennimore didn’t accompany them, although
pressed to do so. “You’ll have a better time by
yourselves,” he declared. “You won’t want any
old chaps like me on hand.”</p>

<p>There was one last, final, ecstatic meeting in
the assembly hall on Friday night at which
speeches, if you could call them such, were made
by Coach Payson and his assistant, by Captain
Loring, by Trainer Ryan, by Captain Maury, of
the Cross-Country Team, and by Mr. Bendix on
behalf of the faculty. Every speaker predicted
success, which was just as well, since one might
as well talk hopefully even if they don’t feel so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and was cheered to the echo. The Glee Club and
the Banjo and Mandolin Club were on hand to
supply music and enthusiasm reigned supreme
until long after the usual bedtime. And then at
ten thirty the next morning the whole student
body set out for the start of the cross-country
race.</p>

<small>THE CROSS-COUNTRY MEET</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The old Cider Mill, a dilapidated two-story
building from whose roof and walls the rotting
shingles were fast falling away, stood—and for
that matter still stands—on the Broadwood road
a mile from the river bridge. Meeker’s Marsh
edges up to the road there and a sluggish creek
meanders by it and flows through a runway at the
back of the mill before joining the river above
Loon Island. The mill is no longer in use and its
sagging floors and decaying timbers render prowling
through its twilit mysteries an unsafe diversion.
Like most deserted and isolated country
buildings it has gained the reputation of being
haunted. No one, however, takes the report very
seriously, and, for that matter, it would be an
especially healthy and sturdy ghost who would
risk haunting a place which affords so little protection
from the weather. At night, with the
moonlight throwing strange shadows about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
one might well view it askance, but on a sunshiny
November forenoon there is nothing uncanny in
its appearance. On the contrary, it is rather picturesque,
with the moss tinging the shingles and
the weeds and bushes crowding about its door.</p>

<p>It was at the old Cider Mill that the start of
the cross-country race was to be made. From
there the course led up the Broadwood road for
a mile, crossed the fields and hills southward for
three quarters of a mile, found the road to Greenburg,
passed through that town on a back street,
continued to the fork near the river bridge,
turned north again past the starting point and
finished a mile beyond toward Broadwood. Taken
as a whole, the four-mile course was not a difficult
one, since only about a fourth of the distance lay
off the roads. Each school entered ten men, of
whom only the first seven to finish were to count
in the result, the first to be credited with one
point, the second with two, the third with three,
and so on, the team scoring the lowest number of
points with its first seven runners to win the race.</p>

<p>Ryan chose his ten runners from the dozen
at his disposal on the showing made during the
last fortnight, and both Gerald and Jake Hiltz
were given places, while Henderson and Groom,
neither of whom had been doing at all well of late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
were left disconsolate outside the ranks. Gerald
had been hoping for a place and more than half
expecting it, so he was not surprised when Ryan
read his name off with the others, who were
Captain Maury, Goodyear, Norcross, Wagner,
French, Felder, Thompson and Sherwood. Goodyear
and Wagner were believed to be Yardley’s
best runners, with Captain Maury a close third,
and the Dark Blue was hoping strongly that Goodyear
would wrest first place away from the Broadwood
crack, Scott, although the latter had a reputation
as a distance runner which no one dared
dispute.</p>

<p>At a few minutes before eleven the teams
lined up in two ranks across the road and the
rules governing the race were explained to them.
Gerald found himself in the second rank between
Felder, of his own team, and a tall, fast-looking
Broadwood youth. The Broadwood runners were
very neat and jaunty in their new costumes of
dark-green shirts and white trunks. Yardley,
who had not considered the matter of attire until
too late, wore white shirts and trunks with a blue
ribbon across the breast. On the backs of the contestants
were pinned their numbers. Most of the
spectators at the starting point owned allegiance
to Yardley, although a sprinkling of Broadwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
fellows had journeyed over to see the teams get
away. It was at the finish, however, that Broadwood
had congregated most of her supporters.
At two minutes after the hour the word was given
and the twenty runners trotted away from the
line.</p>

<p>A four-mile cross-country race isn’t exactly a
sprint and there was no rush for the front, no
jockeying for position, such as takes place at the
beginning of a half or quarter. There was plenty
of time for spurting after the fellows had got
their pace and their wind. Gerald found himself
in the middle of the group after the first few hundred
feet had been run, with Jake Hiltz just ahead
of him. I’m forced to confess that Gerald’s ambition
that morning was not so much to assist in
a victory over Broadwood as it was to defeat Jake
Hiltz, and even at the start of the contest Gerald
suited his pace to Hiltz’s and settled down to run
that youth off his feet irrespective of what happened
to anyone else. It was easy enough going
for the first mile, for the Broadwood road is well
traveled and fairly level. As they approached the
point where the course left the highway and entered
the fields, and where they were to finish later
on, they were met with cheers from the crowd
of Broadwood spectators lining the road there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go it, Scott!” was the cry. “Beat ’em out!
You can do it!”</p>

<p>The runners turned into the field with the
Broadwood cheer ringing in their ears. By this
time the group had lengthened to a procession,
with Scott, the Broadwood crack, leading Goodyear,
of Yardley, by a dozen feet. Then came
Captain Maury and Arthur Thompson, and two
Broadwood fellows close on their heels. Farther
back Gerald was keeping a yard or so behind Jake
Hiltz. He had found his second wind now and,
although he was the youngest entry in the race,
his form aroused several comments from the
audience at the turn.</p>

<p>“Look at the kid,” said one fellow. “Gee,
Yardley must be hard up for runners to
put him in. Say, he can run, though, can’t he?
Isn’t that a pretty stride of his? Wonder who
he is.”</p>

<p>“That’s young Pennimore,” some one informed
him. “John T.’s son. They say he will
have more money than he will know what to do
with when he grows up. The old man’s a multi-millionaire,
whatever that is!”</p>

<p>“Well, he certainly has a pretty way of using
his legs,” said a third, “kid or no kid.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t so easy now that they had the rough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
frosty turf under foot, and soon they were taking
a long hill. The stragglers began to drop farther
behind. Between Scott and Goodyear and the
next group the distance lengthened. Thompson
had dropped back and two Broadwood runners
and Wagner, of Yardley, had passed him. Hiltz
and Gerald were well toward the last. Once Hiltz
glanced back and saw Gerald behind him. “Hello,
Miss Nancy,” he called over his shoulder. “Aren’t
your little legs tired?” Gerald didn’t waste his
breath answering. At the top of the hill Gerald
looked back. The last half dozen fellows were
strung out for an eighth of a mile, some of them,
noticeably Norcross of Yardley, making hard
work of the slope. A couple of stone walls had
to be negotiated next and Arthur Thompson, who
had fallen back to within a dozen yards of Gerald,
tried to take the second one at a jump. His foot
struck in going over, however, and he fell on the
other side and measured his length in a patch of
brambles. Gerald paused as he reached him.
Arthur was climbing slowly and rather dazedly
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Aren’t hurt, are you?” asked Gerald anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve got a beast of a stitch in my
side, Gerald. I’m afraid I’m out of it.” Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
trotted along with his hand on his ribs. “That
hill did it. I was all right until then.”</p>

<p>“Take it easy. Maybe you’ll get over it,” said
Gerald. “Let’s move up; I don’t want Hiltz to
get too much of a lead.”</p>

<p>“You go on,” answered Arthur with a groan.
“I’ll go slow for awhile and see if the pain lets
up. Maybe I’ll manage to get a place.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Gerald. “Don’t give
up.”</p>

<p>Hiltz had gained most of a hundred yards,
but Gerald set to work doggedly and unhurriedly,
and by the time they had skirted the woods and
had found the Greenburg road he was once more
on Hiltz’s heels, much to that youth’s surprise and
displeasure. The race was half run now and
Scott and Goodyear were still going easily and
well within two yards of each other. But they had
pulled ahead of the rest and were far down the
road when Gerald felt the hard ground under foot
again. The outlying houses of the town came into
sight and soon they were speeding along a back
street between rows of tenements and laborers’
cottages. Hiltz and Gerald were running twelfth
and thirteenth now and the pace had begun to tell
on both. Hiltz had eased up perceptibly and
Gerald could hear his deep gasps for breath. Gerald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was in better shape, but nevertheless he was
not at all ill pleased when Hiltz began to slow
down. Before they had left the town two Broadwood
fellows and French of Yardley passed them.
French was making hard work of it, although he
tried to grin bravely as he called: “Come on, you
fellows! We’ve got it cinched!” A quarter of a
mile farther on, however, they overtook him walking
at the side of the road with drooping head.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” called Gerald as he trotted by.</p>

<p>French lifted a drawn, tired face, nodded and
smiled wryly.</p>

<p>Then the bridge was in sight and, this side of
it, the abrupt turn into the Broadwood road that
announced the beginning of the final mile. Gerald
was watching Hiltz sharply now, wondering
whether to try him with a spurt. As they reached
the turn he made up his mind and, quickening his
pace, ran inside of his rival and gained the lead.
But Hiltz, although taken by surprise, wasn’t
dead yet, and in the next fifty yards he had passed
Gerald and regained the lead. And Gerald, quite
satisfied, settled down into his former pace and
plugged away with aching muscles and tortured
lungs. Far up the road Scott and Goodyear were
struggling for supremacy, two white specks in the
distance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>AT THE FINISH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As soon as the runners had gotten away the
spectators at the old Cider Mill set out along
the country road for the finish, a mile away toward
Broadwood. Some few had bicycles, but the
most of them walked. Among the latter were Dan
and Alf and Tom. Paul Rand had started out
with them, but somewhere along the way he had
fallen in with friends and had deserted them.
When they reached the finish they found a comfortable,
sunny place on the hillside and spread
their sweaters.</p>

<p>“It’s warming up,” said Alf, “and I guess we
won’t catch cold. I don’t want any of you fellows
stiff this afternoon, though. We’d better not sit
here too long, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is all right,” muttered Tom, squatting
down. “What time do the coaches start for
Broadwood, Alf?”</p>

<p>“One thirty. And luncheon’s at twelve forty-five
prompt. What time is it now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eleven twenty-five,” answered Dan. “Say,
who’s going to umpire? Didn’t Payson say that
Wallace couldn’t come?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t know who they’ll get. It’s up
to Broadwood. They’ve got two or three men
over there that’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>They talked over the afternoon’s game for
awhile, contrary to Payson’s instructions, and
then Mills, the Broadwood captain, spied them
and joined the group. Mills was a big, broad-shouldered
chap of twenty, a splendid guard and
a splendid fellow as well, and every man who had
ever played against him liked him thoroughly.
He and Alf shook hands, and then Tom greeted
him and Alf introduced Dan.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you, Mr. Vinton,” said Mills
warmly. “I don’t believe, though, that we need
an introduction. I guess we remember each other
from last year, don’t we? Anyhow, I remember
you—to my sorrow.”</p>

<p>Dan smiled.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll remember us all to your sorrow
this afternoon,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” laughed Mills. “Well, what do you
say about it, Loring?” he asked, turning to the
rival captain. “How’s it coming out?”</p>

<p>“If I knew I’d tell you,” replied Alf dryly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“Honestly, Mills, I wouldn’t attempt to guess.
You fellows have got a ripping good team; we all
know that; and we’ve got a pretty fair one too.
And there you are. You’ve had some good coaching
this year, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Mills nodded.</p>

<p>“No kick there,” he said. “And we’ve got
some good players. Well, I want to win, and I
guess you do, too, Loring. However it comes out
it’s going to be a good game. I wouldn’t miss it
for a million dollars. By the way, you fellows
are going to use the gym this year. We’ve fixed
it so you can have the upstairs floor. That all
right?”</p>

<p>“It’s fine, thanks,” answered Alf gratefully.
“It beats trying to keep warm in one of those
confounded coaches. It’s mighty decent of you
chaps.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. I don’t see why we haven’t always
done that. I guess the time’s going by when it’s
the style to make the other fellow as uncomfortable
as possible in the hope that it’ll affect his
playing. Say, you had a rough deal at Brewer,
didn’t you? What was the matter with that referee?
I sent Foley and Robinson over to see the
game and they were telling me about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was just crazy under foot like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
radish,” answered Alf disgustedly. “The ball
was dead and he didn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“Too bad. By the way, how’s this stunt coming
out?” asked Mills with a nod toward the finish
line.</p>

<p>“Oh, we have this affair cinched,” said Tom
lazily. “We’ve filled all our runners with oxygen
and put motors on ’em. You can’t beat ’em, Mills.”</p>

<p>“I guess not, in that case. Well, I must mosey
along. See you all this afternoon, fellows, and I
hope we’ll have a good, clean game. And if you
win, why, it’s all right—until next time. Only I
won’t be here next time.”</p>

<p>“Same with me,” said Alf. “But maybe we’ll
have a crack at each other in college, Mills. You’re
for Princeton, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I pass! You going up to Yale?” Alf
nodded.</p>

<p>“Same ‘if.’”</p>

<p>“Well, good-by,” said Mills, nodding. “Some
of those runners ought to be turning up pretty
soon, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“He’s a mighty decent chap,” mused Alf,
when the visitor had strolled away toward where
the Broadwood contingent was grouped at the
finish. “Wonder why we didn’t get him at Yardley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can’t have all the good things,” murmured
Tom. “You’ve got me, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do know it, you old chump.” There
was a cry from a youth who was watching the
road from the vantage point of a tree limb and
the trio scrambled to their feet, rescued their
sweaters and pushed their way through the crowd
which was struggling for positions along the road.</p>

<p>“There they come!” was the cry. “Two of
them!”</p>

<p>“That’s Scott!” shrieked a Broadwood
youngster.</p>

<p>“And the other one’s Goodyear, or I’ll eat my
hat!” muttered Alf. “Say, who’s got a piece of
paper. Let’s keep score on them as they finish.
We can’t wait around here until those silly judges
get through figuring it up or we’ll never make
school in time for luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Here’s an envelope you can have,” said Dan.
“Got your pen?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Look at Goodyear, Tom! He’s passing
him, by Jove! Come on, you Goody! Eat him
up!”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the leaders, heads
back now and arms hanging listlessly. It was a
gallant fight for four miles in time that set a dual
record for the distance that has never yet been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
surpassed over the course. A hundred feet from
the finish the two were running side by side. At
half the distance Goodyear went ahead. Scott
tried his best to pull down the scant lead, but
the Yardley man held it to the line, crossing
a bare two feet to the good and securing for the
Dark Blue the individual honors of the meet,
no matter what might happen later. Yardley’s
cheers filled the air, and, after the first moment
of disappointment, Broadwood added a hearty
cheer for her rival to the applause she accorded
Scott.</p>

<p>“Yardley, 1; Broadwood, 2,” murmured Alf,
setting the figures down. “So far so good. Any
more in sight, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Don’t see any, but there’s a lot of chumps
on the road. Some one ought to make ’em
keep off.”</p>

<p>There was a wait then until the next group appeared.
At sight of them Yardley again broke
into shouts, for the runner ahead wore the blue
stripe.</p>

<p>“It’s Maury,” said Alf. “I know the way he
runs. The others are both Broadwood chaps.”</p>

<p>Maury finished well ahead and Andrews and
Crossett, of Broadwood, got fourth and fifth place
respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does that make it?” asked Dan, leaning
over Alf’s shoulder as the latter set the figures
down.</p>

<p>“Make it four to their eleven, but they’ve finished
three men to our two. Who’s this coming?”</p>

<p>“Two Yardleys with no one else near,” cried
Dan. “I don’t know who they are. Yes, I do,
though. The first man’s Wagner.”</p>

<p>“And the next is Sherwood,” added Tom.
“And there come two of our hated rivals, and I
hope they choke.”</p>

<p>Wagner and Sherwood trotted across the line
and subsided into the arms of their friends, limp
and tuckered. Then came Holder and White,
both wearers of the Green, and after that there
were no more for several minutes.</p>

<p>“The score, gentlemen,” announced Alf,
frowning over his scrawls, “is Yardley, 17; Broadwood,
28.”</p>

<p>“Great!” cried Dan, with a caper.</p>

<p>“Maybe, but they’ve got five men in to our
four.”</p>

<p>“That can’t be right,” Tom objected.</p>

<p>“Can’t it, Mr. Fixit? Why not? Look here.
Yardley gets first, third, sixth and seventh places,
and that makes seventeen. See? And Broadwood
gets second, fourth, fifth, eighth and ninth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which foots up twenty-eight. I guess we’ve got
to get the next runner in, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” began Tom. But just then
a shout went up and the crowd moved forward
again. Far up the road trotted a single runner
and Yardley sighed her relief, for his shirt shone
white in the sunlight. A moment later a second
runner appeared, a dark-shirted youth who, in
spite of the distance between him and the man
in front, seemed determined to overtake him.</p>

<p>“But he can’t do it,” whispered Dan half
aloud. “Our chap’s got too much lead. Why,
that’s Thompson, Alf.”</p>

<p>“So it is. Good for him! Come on, you
Thompson. Never mind about looking back. Hit
it up!”</p>

<p>But Arthur was still too far away to hear this
advice. The Broadwood runner was gaining in
a way that would have elicited warm admiration
from the trio at any other time. Arthur was plainly
on his last legs. Twenty yards from the line
he stumbled, recovered himself and came on, only
to fall in a heap finally in the middle of the road
some ten yards from the finish.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>BY ONE POINT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Don’t touch him!” was the cry as sympathetic
friends rushed to Arthur’s assistance.
“Let him alone! Let him finish! Come on,
Thompson! You can do it! Here he comes!”</p>

<p>Broadwood was yelling madly, encouragingly
to her plucky runner, who, seeing his adversary’s
plight, was making one final effort to wrest the
victory from him. But he was still yards behind
when Arthur found his feet unsteadily, cast a look
to the rear, and limped, swaying and clutching,
toward the finish. Once across it he sprawled
face down in the road before willing arms could
reach him, and the Broadwood runner, crossing
the line the next instant, stumbled over him and
measured his length, too, on the ground.</p>

<p>“Bully work!” commented Alf, his pen busy
again. “That gives us tenth place and Broadwood
eleventh. Say, this is getting rather too close to
be interesting. What we need is two more runners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
just about now, before Broadwood finishes
her last man.”</p>

<p>“And one of them is coming,” said Dan excitedly.
“It’s a Yardley runner, isn’t it, Tom?
See his white shirt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a Yardleyite, all right,” Tom muttered.</p>

<p>“Sure?” asked Alf, trying to glimpse the distant
road. “Then that makes our sixth man and
the score is—by Jove, fellows! What do you
think?”</p>

<p>“We don’t think; what is it? Are we ahead?”</p>

<p>“We’re just even; 39 to 39!”</p>

<p>“Oh, your score is crazy,” said Tom.</p>

<p>But Alf went over it, while Felder finished
amid the plaudits of his schoolmates, and found
it correct.</p>

<p>“That means, then,” commented Tom, “that
we’ve got to get the next runner in or lose the
shindig. I guess I’ll take a nap until the excitement’s
over. I have a weak heart.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Dan nervously, “this
<em>is</em> sort of suspensous.”</p>

<p>“Whatever that may be,” added Alf. “Gee,
I wish some one would come along and get it over.
What time is it? How long will it take us to get
back? What are they cheering about now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just to keep their courage up, I guess,” answered
Tom.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged along while anxious eyes
searched the distant bend of the road impatiently.
And then, finally, a shout went up from the
throng.</p>

<p>“Broadwood! Broadwood!” shrieked the
Green’s supporters.</p>

<p>“That right?” asked Alf. Dan nodded.</p>

<p>“Then we’re dished!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Alf, there’s another fellow just behind
him. Never say die!”</p>

<p>Yardley’s cheers drowned Broadwood’s now,
for the second runner was all in white and the
distance between him and the man ahead was not
so great, after all. The crowd flowed over onto
the road, amid the appeals of the officials for
“Track, please! Track! Everyone off the road!
Let them finish! Give them room!”</p>

<p>Far up the road sped Green and Dark Blue,
but as they came nearer and nearer it was evident
that Dark Blue was gradually lessening the
distance between him and his foe. Inch by inch,
foot by foot the Yardley runner conquered the
space, and a hundred yards from the finish he
was almost within reach of the Broadwood man.
Dan gave a whoop of delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you see who it is, Tom?” he cried.</p>

<p>“No, but he’s a little cuss. Say, it isn’t——”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, it’s Gerald!”</p>

<p>“Get out!” gasped Alf.</p>

<p>“It is, though, isn’t it, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Gerald for a dollar!” cried Tom delightedly.
“And he will get him yet!”</p>

<p>“The plucky little beggar!” exclaimed Alf.
“Can he do it? Think of the race depending on
him, Dan! Wouldn’t that jar you? Is he gaining?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe so,” muttered Dan anxiously.
“He cut down a lot, but he’s just about
holding his place now. He runs well, too, and
looks fresher than the other chap. Oh, gee, Alf,
why doesn’t he try harder?”</p>

<p>A groan went up from the Yardley watchers,
for the Broadwood runner had suddenly sprung
away and now a good four or five yards separated
him from Gerald, and the finish was almost at
hand.</p>

<p>After that first attempt to leave Hiltz behind
Gerald had subsided into a pace that kept him
just at the other’s heels. There was time enough
yet, for it was evident that Hiltz was fast getting
weary. And then, a minute or two later, Arthur
Thompson drew up to them, passed them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
went ahead, running at a good speed but looking
pretty white of face save where a flaming disk of
crimson burned on each cheek. Gerald saw his
opportunity and seized it. He sprang forward,
passed Hiltz and fell in behind Arthur, letting the
latter make pace for him. Hiltz made one despairing
effort to follow and then gave up the struggle,
trotting along for a minute more and finally
subsiding to a walk as the two others left him
behind.</p>

<p>The last mile was almost half covered when
Bailey, of Broadwood, overtook them, running as
though he had not already put three and a half
miles behind him. Thompson accepted the challenge
and the two gradually drew away from
Gerald who tried to keep up with them but found
it impossible. Then Felder passed slowly, turning
to give Gerald a drawn but encouraging smile.
And then the last turn was in sight. Gerald
glanced back to see if Hiltz was dangerously near.
He wasn’t, but the tall Broadwood chap who had
stood beside him at the start was coming up hard.
Gerald had scant idea now of figuring in the result
of the contest, but since Hiltz was out of the
running the newcomer offered him other rivalry.
So Gerald let out another notch, more to see what
he could do than for any other reason, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
awhile kept the Broadwood man behind. But
Gerald didn’t care a great deal, now that he had
worsted Hiltz, and so presently, when Loughan,
of Broadwood, spurted, he only half-heartedly contested
honors with him, being content to fall in
behind and to ease up sufficiently to get some relief
from the ache and pull at his tired lungs.</p>

<p>He expected to find, when the turn was past,
that the race would be over and thought to meet
his fellows homeward bound on the road. But a
quite different sight met his wearied gaze. Off
there at the finish the road was black with fellows
and the sound of their cheering came plainly to
him. His heart leaped. Perhaps, after all, he
was still in the running! At least, he wouldn’t
chance it. Up came his head then and his legs
began to twinkle faster over the rutted road. Little
by little he reduced Loughan’s lead, delighted
to find that he still had strength and breath in his
tired, aching body. Quite clearly now the wild,
imploring cheers of Yardley and Broadwood
reached him and he no longer doubted that something,
whether much or little he didn’t know, depended
on his beating that boy ahead.</p>

<p>The finish was barely a hundred yards distant
now and Gerald was almost up to Loughan, and
the knowledge came to him that he was in better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shape than the other and could win if the distance
was only great enough. And then, suddenly, the
other bounded forward and in half a dozen strides
had opened up as many yards between them.
Gerald with a gasp called every muscle and ounce
of remaining strength into play and spurted gallantly
after him. But the line was coming toward
them fast and the distance between blue ribbon
and green shirt lessened but slowly. And yet lessen
it did, for the Broadwood man had shot his
last bolt, and shot it too early, and ten yards from
the line Gerald was even with him.</p>

<p>The air was full of sound, deafening, thunderous.
Gerald set his eyes on the line and strove to
draw away from that bobbing blur of green beside
him. Three strides—another—and the green
was still there, although how he knew it he
couldn’t have told, since his eyes never left the
finish in all that final agonizing effort. Another
stride—and another—and there was a new note
in the bedlam of sound. The blur of green was
no longer there and the finish line was under foot!
If only he could keep his legs a moment, an instant
longer. But it was no use! He felt his
limbs giving way beneath him; he struggled for
breath and fell forward, groping blindly.</p>

<p>But eager arms caught him beyond the line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and at a little distance, Alf, trying hard to keep
his pen steady, was setting down the final score:</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Yardley</span>, 52; <span class="smcap">Broadwood</span>, 53.</p>

<p>Gerald had won the Cross-Country by one
point.</p>

<small>OFF TO BROADWOOD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a very tired and rather sick Gerald
that bumped home in the coach with his head on
Arthur Thompson’s shoulder. He was thoroughly
used up, and that was all there was to it, he
told himself. If he hadn’t had to make that spurt
in the last quarter of a mile he would, he was certain,
have finished the race quite fresh. But the
final demand on his powers had been almost too
much for him. Not that he regretted it for an
instant. He was mighty glad he had beat Loughan
and so secured the contest for Yardley. In fact,
he was secretly a little bit proud of himself, which
emotion was, after all, quite excusable. It was
his first real athletic triumph, and it had been won
in the face of the whole school. He guessed that
now they wouldn’t believe Hiltz’s lie about his
having cheated in the trial run! He glanced down
the length of the swaying coach to where Hiltz,
looking rather the worse for his morning’s exertions,
was sitting in the far corner. He didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
seem happy, Gerald thought, and for the first time
since he had left Hiltz behind in the race the
recollection of his victory over his rival brought
no thrill. After all, to have defeated Hiltz was a
small thing compared with having won the day
for Yardley!</p>

<p>If Gerald was a little proud of himself, the
school was even prouder. Every fellow who won
a place in the event came in for his meed of praise
and admiration from his fellows, but Gerald’s
case was unique. As Joe Chambers said, he was
“such a little tyke, you see!” And while all the
others, Goodyear and Maury and Wagner and
Sherwood and Thompson and Felder, had each
helped to win the meet, it was Gerald, the youngest
chap participating, who had at the last possible
moment snatched it out of the fire. He was
the real hero of the day, and so they had clustered
about him and tried to shake his hand or thump
him on the back and had cheered him over and
over and for a minute or two had acted quite like
crazy folks. Gerald had been only dimly aware
of this, however, and the cheering had seemed to
come from a long way off. It was only when the
last man had finished and Arthur had half lifted
him into the coach that he had regained his wandering
faculties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>About him the fellows were talking merrily,
discussing and explaining and questioning. Goodyear
told how Scott had tried to make him take
the lead at the third mile and how he had refused
the honor, preferring to let the Broadwood crack
choose the pace, and how Scott had grumbled at
intervals all the rest of the way, accusing him of
being a “quitter.”</p>

<p>“I was awfully surprised to see you go by,”
said Gerald rather weakly to Arthur.</p>

<p>“I was surprised myself,” laughed Arthur.
“Gee, I never had such a stitch in my side as I
had to-day. I thought for awhile that I was surely
down and out. But after I’d taken it easy for
a bit it got a whole lot better and finally it went
away altogether and I felt finer than I had since
the start. If the race had been a mile or so longer
I guess I could have finished way up front. Well,
you certainly smeared Jake all right, didn’t you?
When I came across you two it looked as though
you’d sworn undying friendship and wouldn’t be
parted for anything. You were putting your
spikes down in his footsteps every time.”</p>

<p>“I had him beaten from the beginning,” said
Gerald, “but he didn’t know it. I let him make
the pace and all I had to do was to stay with him
and let him worry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I guess he worried, judging from the
way he’s looking now. Guess he hasn’t stopped
yet. He’s probably wondering how he’s going to
explain it, after his story about the trial. I think
I’ll ask him, Gerald; bet you he will tell us he
had a stitch in his side.”</p>

<p>“Please, I’d rather you didn’t,” begged Gerald.
But Arthur either didn’t hear or didn’t heed.</p>

<p>“Say, Jake,” he called, “what happened to
you to-day?”</p>

<p>Hiltz looked up scowlingly. “Had a pain,” he
answered morosely. “I’d have finished ahead of
you if I hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Arthur sympathetically while
a quiet smile traveled up and down the coach. “I
had one myself and know what it’s like. Anyone
see Norcross? He was out of it almost from the
start. Guess he wasn’t feeling very fit to-day.”</p>

<p>“He went home long ago,” said Felder. “I
met him just as we made the turn down there.
Told me he was all in, and looked it, too.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Maury. “He’s a good runner
when he’s in shape. Well, fellows, we must
do this again next year, now that we’ve got
started. Ryan says we ought to keep up the interest
by holding a school run in the spring and
getting all the fellows to come out for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Might have a class race,” suggested Goodyear.</p>

<p>“Bully idea,” Sherwood agreed. “I don’t see
why we shouldn’t build up a good cross-country
reputation here at Yardley.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care so much about the reputation,”
put in Wagner, “if we can only beat Broadwood
two years out of three.”</p>

<p>“Why not three out of three?” asked Maury
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, we mustn’t discourage them. They
might quit, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, they wouldn’t,” said Sherwood. “Broadwood’s
no quitter. I’ll say that for her.”</p>

<p>“I thank you on behalf of our defeated rival,”
said Maury, with a polite bow. “You’re going
over to the game, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Rather! I guess every fellow in school is
going. There’s going to be five coaches, all they
could scrape up, and a bunch of us will have to
walk.”</p>

<p>“I shall borrow Hal’s motor cycle,” remarked
Felder carelessly. Goodyear punched him playfully
in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Over my dead body, sonny! I need that myself.”</p>

<p>“Then you may take me on the handle bars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, if you’ll stand the risk, I will. Got
your life insured?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I put thirty cents on it only yesterday.
The policy is payable to you, Hal.”</p>

<p>“My, I don’t see how you got so much!” said
Maury. “Wonderful what risks these insurance
companies will take nowadays to get business,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“All out, gentlemen!” called Goodyear.
“Yardley, Yardley! One hour for dinner!”</p>

<p>Everyone was very happy, for the morning’s
success was accepted as an augury of an afternoon’s
victory, and dinner was a noisy and merry
affair, so noisy that Mr. Collins, the assistant
principal, arose twice in his place at table and informed
the room at large that “really, gentlemen,
this noise must stop! You are carrying it
too far!”</p>

<p>The football team and substitutes had their
luncheon early and at half past one their two conveyances
were awaiting them. They went off to
cheers from as many of their fellows as were not
engaged in commons, while those that were
scrambled to the windows and shouted from there;
and got another rebuke from Mr. Collins. The
school at large set off on foot, on bicycle and by
coach as soon as dinner was over; all save Gerald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and Arthur and young Harry Merrow. They
traveled to Broadwood in Mr. Pennimore’s big
car, Harry Merrow sitting very proudly beside
the chauffeur and waving his blue flag all the way.</p>

<p>It was an ideal football day for players and
spectators alike. There was an almost cloudless
sky above, while around them stretched a green-and-russet
world bathed in sunshine. The breeze
from the west held a frosty nip, but a good thick
sweater was all the extra clothing required to insure
comfort. Broadwood was in holiday attire
as the machine rolled in at the gate and ascended
the curving road past the dormitories. From almost
every window a green flag with its white B
fluttered, while the front of the gymnasium, which
was on the way to the field, was draped in a great
green banner with the word Broadwood spelled
along its length in startling white letters two feet
high.</p>

<p>The automobile had eaten up the miles in
quick time and Mr. Pennimore’s party was on the
scene before the bulk of the audience had arrived.
They found a place for the car at one corner of
the field, but Gerald and the others voted to see
the contest from the side line nearer the middle
of the gridiron. The small grand stand began to
fill with ladies and their escorts and numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
other automobiles came gingerly across the frosty
turf and found positions near Mr. Pennimore’s
car. By two o’clock the spectators lined the field
two deep, while on the roof of the laboratory near
at hand and in the windows of that building many
Broadwood fellows had found posts of vantage.</p>

<p>Broadwood was first on the field and was
cheered enthusiastically by its supporters and politely
by the Yardley section which had taken possession
of one side of the gridiron. Ten minutes
later Yardley trotted on, Alf leading, and then
the blue flags had their inning and Yardley cheers
arose in volume to the afternoon sky. Broadwood
fulfilled the requirements of the occasion with “a
regular cheer for Yardley fellows, and make it
strong!” And then Yardley yelled “A-a-ay!”
in approval and gratification from across the
field. And promptly at two thirty Mills led his
team to the northern end of the gridiron and
Yardley kicked off.</p>

<p>Coke, the Yardley left tackle, sent the ball
spinning from the tee on a long, low kick to Broadwood’s
two-yard line, where Reid, the Green’s
right half, ran it back past three white lines before
he was stopped. The Broadwood full back
went through Merriwell for a clean five yards, to
the joy of the Broadwood supporters, but on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
next play Roeder threw Reid for a loss and Weldon
was forced to kick. Dan received the ball on
Broadwood’s forty-three yards. Roeder failed to
gain through center and Alf punted to Reid, who
fumbled, Dan recovering the ball on the twenty-eight-yard
line.</p>

<p>Yardley shouted blissfully, for with the pigskin
within the shadow of Broadwood’s goal and
in possession of the Blue a touchdown looked imminent.
And after the next play it looked a good
deal more so, for Roeder was driven through
right tackle eighteen yards, eluding the secondary
defense and being pulled and hauled along in a
way that brought the Yardley supporters in the
stand to their feet. Yardley cheerers demanded
a touchdown with wild, exultant voices as the two
teams faced each other on the nine-yard line.
But Broadwood steadied down and Roeder and
Tom between them only made four yards. On
the next play Loring tried a forward pass to Little,
but the latter failed to reach it and the ball
bounded over for a touchback. Broadwood murmured
its relief.</p>

<p>Weldon, Broadwood’s left tackle, punted out
from the twenty-yard line to Eisner, Yardley’s
full back, who made a dozen yards before he was
tackled. Tom made five through right tackle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Dan failed to gain and Roeder missed first down
by two yards. The ball went to Broadwood on
her forty yards. Broadwood was twice thrown
for a loss and punted again, Dan receiving the ball
on his forty-four-yard line. He was downed in
his tracks by Bishop. Tom and Roeder made
eight yards and Alf punted to Reid, who again
fumbled to Dickenson, on the Green’s thirty-three
yards. On the next play Roeder was thrown for
a two-yard loss and Yardley was set still farther
back for off side. With the ball on the Green’s
forty yards Alf tried an on-side kick which went
to Reid for a fair catch on his twenty-five yards.
Ayres made five yards around Dan’s end and
Rhodes went through center for four more. With
one to gain Weldon punted to Dan who caught
the ball on his forty-yard line. On the subsequent
play Fogg was caught holding and Yardley was
set back fifteen yards. Tom made up the distance
on a skin-tackle play and then plugged center
for nine more, and Yardley cheers arose deafeningly.
It was first down almost in the center
of the field. Alf worked a pretty forward pass
to Coke, which was just long enough to give Yardley
first down again, and then Roeder made three
yards at left tackle and Dan recovered Alf’s
fumble on Broadwood’s forty-five-yard line. Alf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
punted outside to Dowling, and after the ball had
been brought in at the twenty-five-yard line the
Green hammered the Yardley line without much
gain, and Weldon returned the ball to Dan in the
middle of the gridiron. Eisner punted over the
head of the Broadwood quarter and the ball
rolled over the line for the second touchback of
the game.</p>

<p>From the twenty-yard line Weldon again
punted and Dan misjudged the kick and fumbled.
Alf, however, was on hand and got the ball before
the Broadwood end reached him, tearing off
five yards before he was brought down. After
that for a while the ball went back and forth between
the twenty-five-yard lines until, near the
end of the period, Broadwood made two on-side
kicks successfully and for the first time in the
game had the ball in her possession inside Yardley
territory. It was well inside, too, for after
the recovery of that second on-side kick by Johnson,
the Broadwood center, the pigskin rested on
Yardley’s eighteen yards. For almost the first
time Broadwood had good and sufficient reason
for rejoicing, and rejoice she did. The green flags
waved wildly and along the side of the field the
local enthusiasts capered and shouted. Rhodes
made a scant three yards at Little and on a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
attempt was thrown for a loss. Captain Mills and
his quarter back held a consultation and then
Weldon was called back and everyone knew that
Broadwood was about to try a goal from field.
Weldon placed himself on the twenty-seven-yard
line and held his hands out, the ball went back
to him on a good pass and he tried a drop kick.
But the ball fell short and Dan pulled it down
and was not caught until he had wormed and
fought his way back to the twenty-eight yards.
Yardley yelled its triumph and derision and a
depressed stillness encompassed the Broadwood
ranks.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, after Alf had punted to
Broadwood’s thirty-nine yards and Dowling’s on-side
kick had been recovered by Dan, Yardley set
to work and ripped things wide open. There was
a blocked punt luckily recovered by Alf, and Payson
sent Sommers in in place of Eisner. Sommers
was an erratic player, with plenty of strength and
football knowledge when it pleased him to show
them. He showed both to-day, in the remaining
five minutes of the half, for on his first two
plunges directly through the center of the Broadwood
line he netted fifteen yards and made it first
down. Mills was hurt in the second of the rushes
and the play was held up for the full two minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
while he recovered. When he got to his feet
again Yardley cheered him loudly. From the
thirty-seven-yard line Tom went forward for five
yards, Roeder took four more and Tom secured
first down on Broadwood’s twenty-three yards.
Yardley was imploring a field goal, but after a
moment’s hesitation Alf decided that a touchdown
was what was needed and to that end attempted
a forward pass. But again Little failed and
Broadwood got the pigskin eight yards from her
goal line. And at that moment time was called
for the first half.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to it but Yardley!” cried
Gerald as he and Arthur made their way back to
the automobile to rejoin Mr. Pennimore. “We
put it all over them!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we had two chances to score and
missed them both,” objected Arthur.</p>

<p>“Well, Broadwood had one chance and didn’t
do any better,” replied Gerald. “Besides, the
play was in her territory all the time except when
they worked those two on-side kicks; and that was
more luck than anything else!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. The play was pretty even.”</p>

<p>“Why, Broadwood didn’t make a single first
down on rushing!” Gerald scoffed. “And we
made at least four.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just the same Broadwood will come back
hard in the next half. I wish we had managed to
score.”</p>

<p>“So do I, but I’ll bet you we’ll just make rings
around them in the next half. Isn’t Alf playing
a dandy game?”</p>

<p>“Great! I never saw him run the team as
smoothly, and he’s keeping old Broadwood guessing
all the time with the plays he’s using. Broadwood
is sticking to old-fashioned football pretty
well; more than she did last year; and if she loses
it will be only because the two lines are too nearly
even for her to win on line bucking. And Dan’s
doing great work too. He missed only one punt,
and that was a tough one to handle. His backfield
work is fine. And I don’t think the Broadwood
backs got around his end more than once,
either.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to me that Mills is showing
up much,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s hard to tell. Sommers got by him
twice that I know of and Tom didn’t have much
trouble with the center of their line. But it’s hard
to judge of a linesman’s work unless you’re right
on the field there.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is. Hello, dad! Isn’t it great?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” responded Mr. Pennimore, puffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
complacently on his cigar. “Looks as though
we’d win, doesn’t it, son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We’re going to tie strings to them
the next half. Wasn’t Dan fine?”</p>

<p>“He was, indeed. And I thought Tom seemed
to get along pretty well when he had the ball.”</p>

<p>“You bet! Tom always does. He just puts
his head down and gives a grunt and <em>goes
through</em>!”</p>

<p>“That’s a good way to do,” laughed his father.
“Enjoying it, Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Very much, sir. Can you see all right from
here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I stood up on the seat. Nearly fell
off once when What’s-his-name—Roeder—made
that run over there just after the game started.
It was beautiful to see the way they pulled him
along. It seemed to catch Broadwood napping,
didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You bet it did! Isn’t it a dandy day for a
game?” Gerald climbed into the car and settled
down on the back seat and Arthur followed him.
Over at the side of the field the Yardley cheer
leaders were calling “Yardley this way! Yardley
this way!” and the blue flags were massing
together back of the ropes. Soon the singing
began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is Dan’s song,” said Gerald eagerly.
“Listen, father!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘All together! Cheer on cheer!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now we’re charging down the field!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See how Broadwood pales with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Knowing we will never yield!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wave on high your banner blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cheer for comrades staunch and true;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We are here to die or do,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fighting for old Yardley!’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Isn’t that great?” demanded Gerald. “Dan
wrote the words and his sister made the music.”</p>

<p>“The—ah—the music sounds a little bit familiar,
doesn’t it, though?” inquired Mr. Pennimore
with a smile.</p>

<p>“All music does,” replied Gerald seriously.
“Here’s the second verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘All together! Cheer on cheer!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Victory is ours to-day!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Raise your voices loud and clear!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yardley pluck has won the fray!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See, the vanquished foeman quails;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All his vaunted courage fails!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Flaunt the Blue that never pales,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fighting for old Yardley!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Across the empty field the Broadwood supporters
had let their own song die down to listen,
and at the end of Yardley’s effort they cheered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
approvingly and generously. But they didn’t intend
that the enemy should have its own way in
matters musical and so came back with their own
favorite, “Broadwood Green.” They followed
that up with the song that Yardley detested most,
“What’ll We Do?”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘Not far away there is a school<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That thinks it can play ball, sir.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We’ll show it just a trick or two,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We’ll show it what our men can do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>And</em>——<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It won’t think so this fall, sir!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, what’ll we do to Yardley, to Yardley, to Yardley?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, what’ll we do to Yardley?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Well, really, I’d rather not say!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yardley tried to drown the hated words with
much cheering and then retaliated with:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Old Yardley has the men, my boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Old Yardley has the steam,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Old Yardley has the pluck and sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Old Yardley has the team!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Old Yardley can’t be beat, my boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She’s bound to win the game!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So give a cheer for Yardley and<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Hats off to Yardley’s fame!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A moment later the teams returned and the
rival camps strove to surpass each other in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
welcomes. It was Broadwood’s kick off, and in
a moment the ball was high in air, cork screwing
against the blue of the afternoon sky. Mills had
made the kick and it was a good one, high and
far, but his ends were slow in getting down under
it and Dan, catching the ball, reeled off sixteen
yards before he fell into the clutches of the enemy
on his eighteen-yard line. When Yardley lined
up it was seen that Hadlock, at left guard, had
been replaced by Ridge. Alf called on Roeder
and that dependable young gentleman made five
yards. Tom secured four more and Alf punted
to Dowling in the center of the field. The Green’s
quarter back was brought to earth by Ridge.
Then Broadwood for the first time made her distance
by rushing, Rhodes taking the pigskin for
seven yards and then five through center, Mills
making the hole for him superbly. Ayres failed
to gain on the next try to the disappointment of
Broadwood’s friends on the side line, and Rhodes
tried again. But the ball was Yardley’s on downs
after the whistle had blown. Then followed a
punting dual between Alf and Weldon, the ball
sailing back and forth between the two thirty-yard
lines. After the fifth exchange the pigskin
went to Broadwood on her thirty yards. Then
Broadwood hopes revived and Gerald had cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to recall Arthur’s prophecy that Broadwood
would “come back hard.” The Green’s full back
made first down in two plunges at the Blue’s line
and then Ayres ran ten yards around left end.
Broadwood was cheering like mad now. Ayres
was given the pigskin again, but in three attempts
at the Yardley line netted but eight yards and the
ball went to the Blue.</p>

<p>Sommers was pushed and pulled through left
guard for four yards and a penalty gave Yardley
five more. Then Roeder made ten yards in two
fine rushes, and Alf’s forward pass was carried
out in good shape by Dan for a long gain but was
called back. Alf then punted to Ayres and Weldon
returned the kick to Alf, and the latter was
thrown on his twenty-yard line. Roeder by this
time was pretty well played out and Stearns was
substituted, Roeder receiving the biggest kind
of an ovation as he walked uncertainly off the
field.</p>

<p>Stearns was given the ball on the first play
and negotiated three yards at right tackle. Sommers
got five at left guard and Alf punted to
Ayres on Broadwood’s fifty-one yards. Weldon
returned the compliment and Alf made a soul-stirring
running catch of the punt on his twenty-five-yard
line. Tom and Stearns made nine yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
between them and Tom secured first down on a
split play that caught Broadwood napping. Yardley
seemed now to have found her pace, for
Stearns and Sommers twice made first down, and
Broadwood’s line appeared to be weakening. But
the gain went for little, since, on the next play,
Yardley was put back fifteen yards for holding.
The ball was now on Yardley’s forty-seven-yard
line. Alf tried a forward pass to Dan, who
fumbled the ball but recovered it on the enemy’s
forty yards, while the blue flags waved joyously
and the Yardley cheers broke forth again. Stearns
made a gain twice, and Alf once more tried a forward
pass. Dickenson secured it and made twelve
yards before he was stopped. The pigskin was
down on Broadwood’s twenty-three yards now
and Broadwood supporters were imploring their
team to “Hold them! Hold them! Hold them!”</p>

<p>Tom made six yards past Mills and Stearns
failed to gain. The ball was on the Green’s fifteen
yards and pandemonium reigned about the
field. Broadwood and Yardley shouts and cheers
met and mingled in a meaningless jumble of
sound. Another forward pass, Alf to Dan, and
the two teams, desperate, panting, determined,
stood on the seven-yard line. Stearns made two
and Tom two more and the ball was three scant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
yards from the line. And then, amid such an
uproar as Broadwood field had seldom heard, Tom
crashed through right tackle for a touchdown.</p>

<p>That was too much for the Yardley adherents.
Over and under the rope they streamed out onto
the field, while caps and flags sailed in air and
everyone shouted to his heart’s content. The ensuing
two minutes were occupied in clearing the
field, and as Yardley’s rejoicing died down the
Broadwood cheer made itself heard. Then Coke
kicked goal without trouble and again the blue
flags waved. The teams changed goals and Mills
kicked off, but four minutes later the whistle blew
with Yardley in possession of the ball on her
thirty-seven-yard line. The rival elevens cheered
each other breathlessly and started for the gymnasium
as the Yardley fellows streamed onto
the field. One by one the members of the Blue
team were captured and borne off in triumph on
the shoulders of their joyous companions, while
Broadwood cheered her defeated warriors and
sang her songs. As Paul Rand and Goodyear and
another chap set Alf on his feet at the entrance
to the gymnasium Captain Mills came up. His
face was white and tired and drawn, but at sight
of Alf a smile lighted it up and he turned with
outstretched hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was your day, Loring,” he said heartily.
“My congratulations.”</p>

<p>“Sorry we couldn’t both win, Mills,” replied
Alf, as he shook hands. “Your men played a
great game.”</p>

<p>Mills smiled and nodded and passed on into
the building.</p>

<p>“Poor chap!” thought Alf, in genuine sympathy.
“I wonder if I could have smiled like that
if we’d lost. He’s a dandy, big-hearted fellow,
that Mills.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>AROUND THE BONFIRE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Well, Yardley had cause for rejoicing that
day, and rejoice she did; she rejoiced all the way
back to Wissining; she rejoiced all during supper
and she continued to rejoice until long after she
should have been in bed and asleep. It isn’t often
that a school has two victories over her dearest
rival in one day to celebrate, and Yardley realized
the fact and made the most of the privilege. Supper
was a noisy, riotous event, with Mr. Collins
striving hard to maintain some degree of order
without unnecessarily dampening the enthusiasm
with which he was thoroughly in sympathy.
Commons was cleared early in order that the
team might hold its banquet. But, although
driven from the dining room, the fellows didn’t
go farther than the corridor, and when the members
of the team appeared, one by one, they had
to literally fight their way to the door through a
seething throng of shouting enthusiasts. When
they were all inside, players and substitutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
coachers and managers, and Andy Ryan, the
doors were closed and locked, and after a final
cheer that seemed to shake the very foundations
of Whitson, the fellows piled out of the building,
formed into procession and, shouting and singing,
proceeded to follow a long-established custom
and visit the faculty. From building to
building they went and one after another the professors
and instructors showed themselves at the
windows of their rooms, or appeared at the doorways
and made their little speeches of congratulation
and were cheered. Even Mrs. Ponder, the
matron, had to show herself and bow, while “Mr.
McCarthy,” the janitor, got a full-sized cheer as
the procession passed his lodgings in the basement
of Oxford. Finally it was Dr. Hewitt’s
turn and the fellows massed outside his windows
and demanded audience. Presently the curtain
went up in his study and the doctor raised the
window.</p>

<p>“Rah, rah, rah, Hewitt!” was the greeting.
The principal bowed and smiled and held up his
hand for silence. “Old Toby,” as he was called,
was getting well along in years and his voice
didn’t travel very far.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen,” he said, “I am very glad
to learn of your victory——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two of them, doctor!” sung out an irrepressible
youth at the back of the crowd.</p>

<p>“And glad to learn that the contest passed
without injury to any of the players of either
side and without regrettable incidents of any sort.
The game of football, as you all know, is being
much criticised these days and I wish to remind
you that it is only by fair and gentlemanly methods
of play that you can—ah—appease such criticism.
I congratulate you heartily, and thank
you. Good night.”</p>

<p>The doctor bowed again and disappeared to the
accompaniment of a hearty cheer. Then the procession
passed around to the front entrance of
Oxford and broke ranks to await the appearance
of the team. Joe Chambers, who had been appointed
chief marshal of the evening’s proceedings,
dispatched a messenger to the banquet to
learn what progress was being made. He was
back in a jiffy with the report that they were
only half through, and Chambers addressed the
meeting.</p>

<p>“Fellows, the team is only about halfway
through dinner. After dinner they will elect a
captain and that will take some time. I don’t
believe they’ll be ready for an hour yet. Suppose
we march down to the field now and get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
bonfire started. Then when the team are ready
they’ll join us there.”</p>

<p>“Bonfire! Bonfire! On to the field! Fall in
there!”</p>

<p>So the procession formed again and marched
down to the field where material for the fire had
already been assembled. There were half a dozen
nice kerosene barrels and plenty of wood gathered
along the river. There were also some railroad
ties, a portion of a foot bridge and a section of
picket fence which, I fear, had not been so innocently
procured. Willing hands massed the barrels
and piled the miscellaneous material on top
of the pyramid. Then Chambers applied the
match and the flames leaped up.</p>

<p>“Ring! Ring!” was the cry. “Form a ring!
Everyone join hands!”</p>

<p>In a minute some two hundred and forty rollicking
youths were swinging around the fire in
a huge circle, advancing, retreating, winding and
twisting like a snake that had swallowed its tail,
while to the starlit sky two hundred and forty
voices arose in song.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, the wearin’ o’ the Green!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, the wearin’ o’ the Green!<br /></span>

<span class="i1">’Twas the most distressful ruction that ever yet was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When we walloped poor old Broadwood for the wearin’ o’ the Green!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They sang it over and over, keeping time to
their steps. Then the ring began to move faster
and faster until at last it was whirling around the
fire like a mammoth pin wheel, the long shadows
of the leaping figures waving and dancing grotesquely
behind them. The ring broke and met
again, fellows fell and were dragged along willy-nilly
until they found their feet, and all the time
the white stars were informed that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You can always tell a loser by the wearin’ o’ the Green!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Finally, tired and breathless, the fellows
ceased their dancing, the fire was replenished and
speeches were demanded. Joe Chambers was
elevated to the shoulders of three of his comrades,
and when he had found his breath told them that
the day would live forever in the annals of Yardley
Hall School, and the names of the heroes who
had won glory for the Blue on the trampled field
of battle would be for all time emblazoned upon
the tablets of memory. Joe let himself out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the full limit of his oratorical powers and the
audience laughed and cheered and called for more
whenever he threatened to slip from his precarious
seat or ran out of breath. And just when he
was showing signs of real exhaustion the cry went
up that the team was coming, and Joe was deposited
unceremoniously on the ground while a
great shout of welcome went up as the group of
players and coachers came out of the darkness
into the circle of the fire light.</p>

<p>“Who’s captain?” cried a small prep. But
he was promptly sat upon, for it is the retiring
captain’s privilege to announce the result of the
election.</p>

<p>“This way!” shouted Joe Chambers. “Everyone
over to the grand stand!” So everyone
scuttled across the field, the members of the football
team being caught up in the stampede as they
hustled along. The light from the fire illumined
the faces of the players dimly as they climbed
the stand and stood somewhat sheepishly awaiting
proceedings. The cheering came first, with
Joe leading:</p>

<p>“Now, fellows, a regular cheer for Captain
Loring, and make it good!”</p>

<p>Then: “Now, fellows, a regular cheer for Mr.
Payson!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Then: “A short cheer for Dickenson!”</p>

<p>And so it went, every player receiving his applause.
Finally they cheered for Mr. Rogers, the
assistant coach, for the management and for
Andy Ryan, ending up in a long nine-times-three
for Yardley. Then there was a call for “Loring!
Loring! Speech!” Alf stepped to the front of
the stand.</p>

<p>“Fellows, there isn’t much to say, I guess,” he
began earnestly. “But I do want to thank you
all for the way you’ve stood behind the team this
year. You’ve been great to us. We spoke of that
at dinner to-night, and every fellow on the team
or connected with it agreed that the support you
have given us has helped more than you know.
We had our troubles in the middle of the season,
but you didn’t lose faith in us because we were
defeated. You kept up our courage, and to-day,
when we went onto the field at Broadwood, everyone
of us knew that you were right back of us.
And that knowledge helped us to win.”</p>

<p>“A-a-ay!” murmured the audience.</p>

<p>“Now that the game is over,” Alf went on,
“I’ll say frankly that few of us expected to win
it. I didn’t, Mr. Payson didn’t. But we knew
<em>you</em> expected us to, and you saw the way the fellows
played. I’m proud of having captained such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a team. There wasn’t a man on it who didn’t
work every minute from the first of the season
until the final whistle this afternoon with just the
one end in view of beating Broadwood. We’ve
pulled together all the fall. Not a man has
shirked, and the work wasn’t easy sometimes,
either. I want to tell you that you had a mighty
fine team this year!”</p>

<p>Loud agreement from the throng below.</p>

<p>“Now, as to next year. You’ll have the start
of a good team, for only six of the fellows who
started the game to-day graduate this spring.
Then there’s a lot of good material on the Second
team. And right here I want to thank the members
of the Second for the way in which they
worked with us. They got more hard knocks than
glory, and they deserve a whole lot of praise. So,
next year I don’t see any reason why you can’t
have another celebration like this. There are
some of us up here who won’t be on hand to see it,
but we all wish you success, and you may be
pretty sure that when the day of the Broadwood
game comes none of us will be very far from a
bulletin board. Now, I know you want to hear
who it is that is to lead next year’s football team
to victory. We have chosen him, and we did it
on the first ballot. He’s a fellow who has fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
won the honor, not only on account of his playing
both last year and this, but because on a certain
occasion last fall, when certain defeat at the hands
of Broadwood stared us in the face, he endeared
himself to us all by an act of self-sacrifice that
was finer than all the touchdowns ever made.
Fellows, I call for a regular cheer for Captain
Vinton!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE NEW CAPTAIN MAKES A SPEECH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That <em>was</em> a cheer! They might almost have
heard it at Broadwood! “<em>Rah, rah, rah! Rah,
rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah! Vinton!</em>” And after
the cheer every fellow shouted his applause in the
way that best pleased him and the demonstration
threatened to last all night. But some one began
to demand “Speech! Speech! Vinton! Vinton!”
and poor Dan was thrust into the speaker’s place
and the tumult died abruptly.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” began Dan in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Louder!” called those at the edge of the
throng. Dan cleared his throat, smiled nervously
and started again.</p>

<p>“Fellows, I thank you very much. I never
made a speech and so I don’t know how. I——”</p>

<p>“You’re doing fine!” called some one reassuringly,
and in the laughter that ensued Dan gained
courage.</p>

<p>“When they were good enough to elect me
awhile ago the only thing that—that made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
hesitate about accepting the honor was the
thought that if I did I might have to make a
speech! I asked Alf—Captain Loring—and he
said that maybe I could get out of it. I—the only
thing I have to say is that I’m mighty proud to
be captain and I’ll do the best I can. And—and
thank you all. Now let’s have a cheer for Loring!”</p>

<p>And Dan, with a sigh of relief, stepped back
as Chambers led the cheering. After that Payson
said a few words, and then the procession
formed again, marched once around the bonfire,
singing “The Wearin’ o’ the Green,” and went
back up the slope to Oxford, where, massed in
front of the steps, the fellows, with bare heads,
sang “The Years Roll On.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>After that, although many of the fellows still
lingered about the front of Oxford, the celebration
was over with. It was late and most everyone
was tired after what had been a busy and exciting
day. Also, November nights are chilly in
the neighborhood of Wissining and there was an
icy little breeze blowing in from the sound. So
it wasn’t long before the last fellow had sought
the warmth and light of his room, leaving the
white stars alone to look down on the flickering
remains of the fire.</p>

<p>Dan was silent as he climbed the stairs of
Clarke and sought No. 28. To be sure, he went
up alone, after saying good night to Alf and Tom
and Joe Chambers and several others at the corner
of the building, and that might explain it if
it were not for the fact that Dan usually either
sang or whistled as he ran upstairs. To-night
he didn’t even run. He was much too tired and
sore. He had played a hard game for all there
was in it and he had received his full share of
knocks and bruises. There were no scars visible,
but he knew where he could put his hand on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
dandy lump! The fact that he limped a little
with his right leg indicated in a general way the
location of the lump. Besides that, there were
plenty of bruised places, and he had an idea that
by to-morrow he would be an interesting study in
black and blue. When he opened the door of the
room he found Gerald there before him, Gerald
sitting on the edge of his bed partly undressed
and looking very forlorn and a trifle red about the
eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gerald,” exclaimed Dan. “What’s
the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Gerald, diligently hunting
on the floor for a stocking which was draped
gracefully over his knee. Dan went over and
seated himself beside him on the bed.</p>

<p>“Something’s up, chum,” he said kindly, putting
an arm over the younger boy’s shoulders.
“Let’s hear about it.”</p>

<p>“It—it isn’t anything,” replied Gerald with
the suspicion of a sniff. “I guess I’m just sort
of tired.”</p>

<p>“I should think you might be,” said Dan
heartily, “after the work you did this morning!
You made a great hit with the school, Gerald. If
it hadn’t been for you we’d have lost that race as
sure as shooting!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Gerald, after a moment,
aggrievedly.</p>

<p>“What’s just it? You aren’t downhearted because
you ran a bully race and won the meet, are
you?”</p>

<p>“No, but—but other fellows when they win
points for the school get—get recognition!”</p>

<p>“Recognition? Great Scott, chum, the fellows
cheered you until they were hoarse! Didn’t you
know that?”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t hear much of it, but Arthur said
they did.”</p>

<p>“They certainly did! Why, I’ve heard lots
and lots of fellows say how plucky you were and
how glad they were that you beat Jake Hiltz.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t get my Y,” said Gerald. “When
other fellows do anything they get their Y or they
get their numerals or—or something.”</p>

<p>“But none of the Cross-Country Team get a
Y,” exclaimed Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why they shouldn’t, though,”
Gerald mourned. “Do you?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t,” Dan acknowledged. “I guess
next year they’ll change that. You see, chum, it’s
a new sport here and it isn’t exactly recognized
yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s just as hard work as playing basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ball,” said Gerald, “and if you play basket ball
you get your two B’s.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you mention it to Maury? He’s
your captain, isn’t he?” Gerald nodded. “He
might see Bendix about it. I think myself that
you fellows ought to get something in the way of
letters. As you say, it’s just as important as
basket ball.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps I’d get my Y,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“And you were disappointed, eh? Is that it?
Well, cheer up. You’ll get your Y soon enough.
You want to remember that as it is now you can
only get it in football, baseball, track or hockey.”</p>

<p>“Could I get it in hockey?” asked Gerald
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you made the team and played against
Broadwood,” replied Dan with a smile. “But
you’re rather young yet to talk about getting
your Y, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“I’m fifteen. Stevenson is not much older
and he has his. He got it on the track team.”</p>

<p>“He’s the fellow that jumps, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He hurdles.”</p>

<p>“Well, Stevenson is at least a year older than
you are, chum. I tell you what, though; you
ought to be able to get your C this winter if you
make the dormitory hockey team.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want a dormitory letter,” said Gerald.
“I want to get something worth while. I’m
going to ask Alf if he will let me on the hockey
team.”</p>

<p>“He will let you on without being asked if you
show that you deserve a place,” said Dan soberly.
“But don’t try to swipe, Gerald.” Gerald looked
a bit sulky for a minute, but he made no answer.
“I don’t see, though,” Dan continued, “why you
shouldn’t try for the hockey team. You’re a
mighty good skater and you seem to know how
to handle a stick pretty well, although I’m not
much of a judge. The only thing against you is
that you’re pretty light.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to try, anyhow,” said Gerald
more cheerfully. “Are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I promised Alf last year that
I would, and he says he’s going to hold me to it.
But I’m a poor skater and what I don’t know
about hockey would fill a book, and a pretty big
one.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said Gerald. “When do
they start practice?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some time in December; about the middle,
I think. But there isn’t usually much doing
until after Christmas vacation. I suppose it’s a
question of ice. Alf’s got a scheme of flooding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that bit of meadow near the river just this side
of the boat house and having the rink there. He
says the trouble with playing on the river is that
the ice is always cracking. Well, I’m going to
bed. You’d better, too, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Gerald, coming out of his
dreaming. “I’m awfully glad they made you captain,
Dan. But I knew they would.”</p>

<p>“Did you? That’s more than I knew,”
laughed Dan, as he pulled the bed clothes up and
stretched his aching limbs. “I thought it might
be Roeder. He deserved it.”</p>

<p>“No more than you,” asserted Gerald stoutly.
“Not as much. Look what you did last year!”</p>

<p>“Well, what interests me now is next year.
The fact is, chum, I’m in rather a funk about it.
I never realized until to-night what a feeling of
responsibility goes with the captaincy. I almost
wish that Roeder had got it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t. You’ll make a bully captain, Dan.
Everyone likes you, you’re a dandy player and
you know how to boss folks. Do you suppose
Muscles will let me play next year?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so.”</p>

<p>“He ought to. I’ll be sixteen then, and in the
second class. Do you think I’d stand any show of
making it, Dan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“You go to sleep. Sufficient unto the day is
the football thereof. Good night, Gerald. I’m
dead tired.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” answered Gerald. After a
pause he added: “You don’t have to be very heavy
to play quarter, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not very, I guess. Thinking of quarter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve—I’ve been sort of watching Alf
and I think I could play quarter, Dan.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Dan drowsily. “Oh, well,
cut out the conversation, Gerald, and take a fall
out of Morpheus. Gee, but this old bed feels
good!”</p>

<p>Two days later, on Monday the twenty-third,
Cambridge and Oxford held their elections and
Gerald went through with flying colors and became
a member of Cambridge, with the right to
wear the Light Blue in the shape of button or hat
ribbon. Hiltz accepted what couldn’t be helped
with apparent good grace. He and Gerald always
managed to be looking the other way when they
met and they had not spoken since the cross-country
meet. Hiltz also avoided Dan, since he had
not forgiven the latter for beating him at election,
but they nodded or spoke when they met. Arthur,
too, was in Hiltz’s bad books, for Arthur had
never made any secret of his assistance to Dan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
But neither Dan nor Arthur nor Gerald was
troubled about it.</p>

<p>“We’re not very popular with Jake nowadays,”
observed Arthur one evening in Cambridge
as Hiltz entered and passed without apparently
discovering the presence of Arthur and Dan. “I’ll
bet he will make trouble for Gerald before the
year is over.”</p>

<p>“I don’t just see how he could,” said Dan,
“although I don’t doubt that he would like to.
The fellows are rather tired of Hiltz, I think.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but he isn’t tired of himself so that
you can notice it. And he thinks he has a grievance.
We’ll have trouble with him yet, or I miss
my guess, Dan.”</p>

<p>Dan yawned frankly.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we can attend to him when the
time comes,” he said indifferently. “He’s most
all bluff.”</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day dawned clear and crisp.
Dan, Alf and Tom were to dine with Mr. Pennimore
and Gerald at Sound View in the evening
and so they had decided to cut out the Thanksgiving
dinner at school in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>“We won’t be able to do justice to Gerald’s
party if we fill up on turkey at two o’clock,” declared
Alf. “I tell you what, Dan; let the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of us get some grub and have a picnic.” Tom
groaned, but Gerald hailed the proposition with
delight. Dan looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“Rather chilly, isn’t it, for picnics?” he asked,
looking out of the window at the breezy landscape.</p>

<p>“No, that’s where the fun comes in,” answered
Alf. “We’ll wear sweaters and take some rugs.
Then we’ll build a dandy big fire——”</p>

<p>“Where’s this going to be?” inquired Tom
from where he was stretched out on the window
seat with a magazine in his hands.</p>

<p>“Up the river somewhere. We’ll take a couple
of canoes——”</p>

<p>“You’re always suggesting schemes that demand
physical exertion,” protested his roommate.
“Why don’t you ever think up something easy?
Why not stay just where we are and have a good,
sensible time? It’s warm here and I’m quite comfortable.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Dan?” asked Alf, turning
his back on Tom and his objections.</p>

<p>“I’m game,” said Dan. “I love these pleasure
exertions. How about you, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to go. It seems a shame to stay
around school when we have a holiday. What
time would we get back? You know we’re going
for an automobile ride at four.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s something I like,” said Tom approvingly.
“That’s my idea of pleasure—just as long
as I don’t have to blow up any tires.”</p>

<p>“We’d be back by three, easy,” declared Alf.
“What time is it now? Twenty of eleven? Come
on then, fellows. I’ll go down and see what I can
get in the kitchen. You find those football rugs,
Tom, and the rest of you hustle into your sweaters.
We’ll meet at the boat house in a quarter
of an hour.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” murmured Tom, “I have ten
minutes more of comfort.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to telephone my father,” said Gerald.
“He doesn’t want me to go canoeing, you
know, after what happened last spring.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Dan. “You tell him you’re
going in my canoe, Gerald, and I guess he will
let you go.”</p>

<p>So the three hurried off, leaving Tom to settle
himself more comfortably on the cushions and
take up his magazine again with a sigh.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE PICNIC</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At eleven they were paddling up the river
against a stiff tide with the wind quartering the
canoes from across the marshes. There was a big
pasteboard box of luncheon in Alf and Tom’s
craft, while between Dan and Gerald lay a pile
of rugs. Paddling was rather hard work and,
although they started off merrily enough, they
soon relapsed into silence and saved their breath
for their labor. Once past Flat Island it was
easier going, for the stream narrows there and
the banks are higher and afford more protection
from the wind. Half a mile farther Tom protested.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this far enough?” he asked. “What’s
the good of killing ourselves.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a decent place to camp here,” answered
Alf. “Let’s go up where we can find some
trees to break the wind. It isn’t much farther.”
Tom groaned and bent over his paddle again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Gerald had learned paddling the year before
and was quite an adept, but his softer muscles
soon tired and he was heartily glad when Alf
finally called a halt, about a mile and a half from
school.</p>

<p>“Here’s a dandy place,” Alf announced, “over
here on the left.”</p>

<p>“The other side looks better,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“No, because over here we’ll have the trees
between us and the wind. Push her in here, Tom.”</p>

<p>The canoes were nosed up on a yard-wide
beach of soft sand and the boys disembarked.
The bank was only two or three feet high and they
scrambled up it, bearing the provisions and rugs.
There was a little plateau of grass here and back
of it the land sloped up in a tiny ridge thickly
grown with young oaks and stunted, misshapen
cedars. The fringe of trees broke to some extent
the wind, which blew strongly here across a mile
of marsh and meadow. There were no houses
near, although farther up stream and on the other
side a farm was in sight a half mile distant.
There was plenty of wood lying along the bank
and Dan discovered dead cedar which he uprooted
and added to the fuel pile. Alf found a piece of
dry pine wood and splintered it with his knife.</p>

<p>“Who’s got a piece of paper?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t need paper,” said Tom. “Use dry
grass.”</p>

<p>So Alf gathered a few handfuls, leaned his
whittlings neatly upon it, set some larger pieces
on that and felt in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Got a match, Tom?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Tom went through his clothes and shook his
head. Dan followed his example and shook his
head likewise. Alf began to look anxious.</p>

<p>“Got a match, Gerald?” he cried. Gerald,
who was gathering wood at a little distance, answered
promptly and cheerfully.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t, Alf. Will this be enough
wood?”</p>

<p>There was no reply for a moment. Then Alf
answered dryly: “I think so, Gerald. Yes, I
think we have all the wood we can burn—without
a match!”</p>

<p>Dan looked about him, his gaze traveling over
the landscape. Tom grinned.</p>

<p>“Looking for a match factory, Dan?” he
asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>Alf, sitting on his feet, looked ruefully at his
neatly arranged pile of grass and splinters and
wood. Gerald came up cheerfully with an armful
of broken branches.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, “that’s surely enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
There’s a big old log down there, though, if we
need it. It was too heavy for me to carry. What—what’s
the matter?” He stared wonderingly
from one to another of the silent trio.</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of,” answered Dan. “Only
we haven’t any matches.”</p>

<p>“It’s a mere detail, of course,” murmured
Tom carelessly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Gerald blankly.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Alf. “It’s a remark I’ve
been trying to think of for some time. It—it does
full justice to the situation.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look again,” suggested Dan, probing
his pockets. Everyone followed suit, but, although
a great variety of articles were discovered, no one
found a match.</p>

<p>“We’re a parcel of idiots,” remarked Alf earnestly.</p>

<p>“‘We?’” asked Tom in surprise. “No one
told me to bring any matches. If they had I’d
have brought them. Why, the table was just
strewn with them. I noticed them as I left the
room.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder you wouldn’t put a few in your
pocket,” replied Alf disgustedly.</p>

<p>“I thought you were attending to the arrangements,”
said Tom unruffledly. “Well, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
wrap myself in a rug and go to sleep. I just love
these al fresco affairs. I could die picnicking—probably
of pneumonia!”</p>

<p>“It is fun, isn’t it?” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“Absolutely matchless,” replied Tom cheerfully.</p>

<p>Alf sniffed disgustedly.</p>

<p>“As there are only two rugs, Tom, you’ll have
to take some one in with you,” said Dan. “We
might go home and have our luncheon in the
room.”</p>

<p>“Go home after coming all the way up here?”
said Alf fretfully. “That would be a silly thing
to do!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m surprised at you, Mr. Vinton,” said
Tom severely. “How much better it would be
to stay here comfortably and enjoy the dear little
breezes that are wandering caressingly down my
spine.”</p>

<p>“I saw a match somewhere,” said Gerald, gazing
into space with a deep frown. Tom viewed
him in mock alarm.</p>

<p>“It’s hunger and exposure,” he whispered.
“He’s raving! He’s seeing matches! It’s a
frightful symptom!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Alf anxiously.
“Where did you see a match?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” prompted Dan, “tell the ladies and
gentlemen where you saw the match. Give all the
details, Gerald. What sort of a match was it?
Not a football match, I hope?”</p>

<p>Gerald looked at them blankly, trying to remember.</p>

<p>“I—it was <em>somewhere</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Go on!” cried Tom hoarsely,
clutching his hands in an agony of suspense.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out the comedy!” begged Alf. “What
are you talking about, kid?”</p>

<p>“Why, I saw a match somewhere—just now—since
we left school,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“I can’t think.”</p>

<p>“Look in your pockets again,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, did it again, then.” Gerald obeyed but
had to shake his head when the search was over.</p>

<p>“I observe,” remarked Tom, as though speaking
to himself, “that yonder lies what looks from
here to be a perfectly good farmhouse. I presume
that there are matches there and that we
might be able to borrow one or two of the priceless
things.”</p>

<p>“It’s a half-mile paddle and a half-mile walk
after that,” said Alf dejectedly. “Still, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
might try it.” Tom looked pained and surprised.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t thinking of trying it,” he assured
them. “I’m not what you’d call an accomplished
canoeist, Alf. I haven’t your skill, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going away up there all alone,”
said Alf positively. “The wind’s too strong. If
one of you fellows will go with me——”</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Gerald. He turned and
sprang toward the bank, the others following.
He clambered into the nearest canoe and began
to peer about. Then he went to the second and
repeated the operation and in a moment exhibited
what at a few yards away had all the earmarks
of a match.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried Dan. “Is it a good one?”</p>

<p>Gerald viewed it dubiously as he clambered
back.</p>

<p>“I—I think so,” he answered, handing it over
for their inspection. Dan examined it and passed
it to Alf, and Alf, with a shake of his head, presented
it to Tom. It was about two thirds of a
sulphur match and had evidently been exposed,
if not to rain, at least to dampness, for the head
had lost its brilliancy of hue.</p>

<p>“A most dissipated looking article,” pondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Tom. “It looks to me like a match with a sad
and eventful past. However”—he returned it to
Alf—“see what you can do with it.”</p>

<p>“You light it, Dan,” said Alf carelessly. But
Dan shook his head.</p>

<p>“It would go out as sure as Fate if I tried it.
You do it, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Never! I decline to assume the terrible responsibility.
Let Gerald perform the mystic
rite.” But Gerald drew back as though Dan were
offering him poison.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare!” he laughed. “Alf, you
do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it won’t light, anyway,” said
Alf, accepting the match and the responsibility.
He looked about him. “There’s no use trying to
light it here in this wind, though.”</p>

<p>“Tom and I’ll hold one of the rugs up,” said
Dan.</p>

<p>“All right. But I’ve got to have a piece of
paper. That old grass may not light.” Finally
Tom sacrificed a half sheet of a letter and the boys
gathered anxiously about the little pile of wood
and grass, into which Alf had thrust the twisted
piece of paper. Tom and Dan held one of the
rugs out to form a screen and Alf knelt down and
seized the match firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Gerald. Alf jumped and
dropped the match.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked crossly, as he
recovered the precious article.</p>

<p>“Don’t scratch it on your trousers,” begged
Gerald. “It’s old and the brimstone might come
off. Scratch it on a rock.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” commended Dan. “Get a
rock, Gerald.”</p>

<p>So Gerald found one and laid it beside the
pile and once more they all held their breath
while Alf, with grim determination writ large
upon his countenance, drew the match lightly
across the stone. There was an anxious moment,
for at first there was no flame to be seen.
But then the paper blackened at the edge and
little yellow tongues began to lick at the dry
grass. Four sighs of relief burst simultaneously
upon the air.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp166">“Don’t take the rug away yet,” begged Alf</a>,
as he watched anxiously with his nose some six
inches from the fire. Gerald stood ready with
more fuel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<a id="i_fp166">
  <img src="images/i_fp166.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_166">“‘Don’t take the rug away yet,’ begged Alf.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Here’s a fine piece of soft pine,” he whispered.
Alf accepted it silently without taking his
watchful gaze from the fire and gingerly added it
to the pile. Another piece followed, and another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
And then, very cautiously, Alf arose, waved aside
the rug and smiled beatifically upon his work.</p>

<p>“There!” he said.</p>

<p>Tom and Dan shook hands in much the manner
in which two Arctic explorers might congratulate
each other at the North Pole. Alf viewed them
disgustedly.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what you chaps are grinning
about. Who made this fire?”</p>

<p>“You applied the match,” replied Tom kindly,
“but without our skillful and well-performed labor
there’d have been no fire. We are the real
heroes of the—the conflagration.”</p>

<p>As the flames leaped up, crackling merrily,
life looked a good deal more cheerful. They piled
on dead branches and driftwood until they were
forced to move away to a respectful distance.
Then they stood and warmed themselves in the
grateful heat. Afterwards they spread the rugs
on the ground and Alf opened the luncheon box.
It was only half past twelve, but their labors and
the keen wind had made them hungry. Gerald
filled the two tumblers with water from the river
and Alf spread out the repast. There was cold
roast beef, crackers, plenty of bread ready sliced,
butter, salt, currant jelly, cake, some chow-chow
pickles which had leaked out of a jelly glass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
got into everything, including the salt and cake,
and four large rosy apples.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Tom, “you must have made love
to the cook, Alf.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied his roommate, who had recovered
his spirits, “no, it was just my manly beauty
and irresistible attraction. Let’s toast some of
the bread, fellows.”</p>

<p>So Alf cut a long branch and sharpened one
end and then sat crosslegged as near the flames
as he could get with a slice of bread impaled on
the end of the improvised toasting fork. It was
warm work, but the others encouraged him from
time to time, and he stuck it out until he had three
slices toasted.</p>

<p>“That first piece is mine,” he finally announced.
“And if anyone wants any more he’ll
have to toast it himself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any more, do you, Tom?” asked
Dan.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” was the cheerful response.
Alf looked around suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Here! You’ve eaten my piece, you cheats!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see any name on the piece I had,”
Tom assured him.</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” said Dan. “Are you sure
it was marked, Alf?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“You go to the dickens!” grumbled Alf, as he
retired from the fire very red of face and moist
of eye. “I’ll give you half of this, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll toast some,” replied Gerald. He
took up the stick, produced his knife and sharpened
the other end as well. Then he put a piece
of bread on one end and stuck the other in the
ground at such a slant that the bread was over
the hot coals. Then he resumed his seat on the
rug.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that!” marveled Tom.
“Isn’t he the brainy little Solomon? I suppose
your boxing lessons taught you how to do that,
Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dry up,” said Alf. “And don’t eat
quite all the cold meat, <em>if</em> you please. Where’s
the chow-chow got to?”</p>

<p>“About everywhere,” answered Dan. “I’ve
no doubt the river’s yellow with it. Here’s what’s
left, though.”</p>

<p>Alf viewed it disgustedly.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder you wouldn’t eat all the lunch,
you chaps, while I work for you and singe my
eyebrows off. Your toast’s burning, Gerald.”</p>

<p>There wasn’t a respectable crumb left when
they had finished the repast. They built the fire
up again and lolled back on the rugs and talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
lazily while the sun traveled westward and the
wind whistled through the trees and sent the
smoke eddying across the river. They talked the
football season all over and played the Broadwood
game again from start to finish. And then
Tom took up the subject of basket ball and outlined
his plans for the season, for he was captain
of the Five. Afterwards the talk went on to
hockey.</p>

<p>“You’re coming out this year,” said Alf to
Dan. “Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t skate for a hang,” Dan objected.</p>

<p>“You’ll pick it up all right. Besides, you could
try for goal. We need a good goal tend and you
wouldn’t have to do much skating there.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to play, Tom?” asked Dan.
Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t have time.”</p>

<p>“Here’s one candidate, though,” said Dan.
“Gerald says he’s going out for the team, Alf.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, kid!” replied Alf. “The
more the merrier.”</p>

<p>“But do you think I’ll have any show?” asked
Gerald eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. Can you skate pretty
well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s a very good skater,” said Dan. “Don’t
lie, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Well, you come out, anyway,” said Alf, “and
we’ll see what happens. Meanwhile I think we’d
better be getting back if the car is to be there
at four. It’s almost three now!”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness we don’t have to paddle
back,” muttered Tom as he arose and stretched
himself. “I’ll put these glasses in. You fellows
bring the rugs. Ought we to put the fire out?”</p>

<p>“No, let it burn out,” said Dan lazily. “It
can’t do any harm.”</p>

<p>Tom walked to the bank, stood there a moment
and then returned and seated himself again on
the rug, the glasses still in his hands.</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” asked Alf, catching sight
of Tom’s face.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking,” replied Tom gravely,
“how often we say things without thoroughly realizing
the deep significance of them. I made the
remark, quite casually, a moment ago that we
wouldn’t have to paddle back.”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Alf sharply, propping
himself up on his elbow.</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t.”</p>

<p>“Of course we won’t! The current will take us
down, you idiot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I see. It will be rather wet, though,
won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Wet? What are you driving at, Tom?” Dan
demanded.</p>

<p>“Me? Nothing at all. If you fellows can
stand it I guess I can. But floating down the
river in this weather sounds sort of wet and
chilly.”</p>

<p>“In the canoes?” inquired Alf uneasily.</p>

<p>“Oh, you meant in the canoes? Well, I don’t
think we’ll go in the canoes.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any,” said Tom.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE RETURN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“What!”</p>

<p>Dan and Alf and Gerald leaped to their feet
and ran to the bank. Then they looked at each
other in blank dismay. Below them the wet sand
still showed where the canoes had rested, but the
canoes themselves had utterly vanished. Tom
sauntered up, his hands in his pockets, whistling
softly.</p>

<p>“It really is a beautiful view from here,” he
murmured. Alf turned on him irritably.</p>

<p>“Tom, don’t be an absolute fool, will you?”
he begged.</p>

<p>“That’s right, cut out the humor for a minute,”
Dan agreed. “There isn’t anything especially
funny about having to walk all the way
home!”</p>

<p>“Thought we were going to float,” said Tom
with a grin. They turned from him in impatient
disgust, Alf muttering things uncomplimentary to
his friend’s mental condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see—” began Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s plain enough,” Alf cut in. “They
weren’t drawn up very far and when Gerald got
in them he pushed them off a little and the wind
did the rest. They’re probably out in the sound
by this time.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” said Gerald humbly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t your fault,” answered Alf.
“We ought to have drawn them up farther. I
never thought about the wind.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“If you’d taken my advice and camped on the
other side,” observed Tom sweetly, “this wouldn’t
have happened.”</p>

<p>“You be blowed! But, see here, Alf; the
wind may have blown them ashore on the other
bank lower down.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t help us much,” replied Alf. “But
we might go down a ways and see if we can find
them.”</p>

<p>“If we do find them I’ll swim over and get
them,” said Dan, as they went along the bank.</p>

<p>“Indeed you won’t! You’d catch cold a day
like this. But I would like to be sure that they
haven’t gone sailing out to sea.”</p>

<p>They went on silently and dejectedly for nearly
a quarter of a mile. There their farther progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was barred by a small stream which flowed into
the river from the marsh.</p>

<p>“We might get across this by wading,” said
Dan, “but there are any number more of them.”</p>

<p>The canoes were not in sight, although from
where they had halted they could see both banks
of the river as far as the next turn, an eighth of
a mile below.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done?” asked Alf.</p>

<p>“Walk home,” answered Dan. “It’s about
six miles, though, the way we’ll have to go, for
we’ll have to make a circle around the marsh
and hit the Broadwood road somewhere beyond
the Cider Mill. Even so, we’re in for wet
feet.”</p>

<p>“If we were only on the other side,” mourned
Gerald.</p>

<p>“That would be a cinch,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“‘Over on the Jersey side,’” hummed Tom.
“Look here, six miles may appeal to you chaps,
but it likes me not.”</p>

<p>“Well,” inquired Alf belligerently, “what do
you propose, Mr. Fixit?”</p>

<p>“I propose, Mr. Grouch, that we walk <em>up</em> the
river instead of down.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Dan. “There’s a bridge
about a mile and a half up there. That would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
make it only about four miles and a half to school
instead of six.”</p>

<p>“And six is a most optimistic calculation of
the other route,” added Tom. “I’ll bet it’s nearer
seven.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there’s any place in this old
stream where we could ford it, is there?” asked
Alf, looking wrathfully at the river.</p>

<p>“Guess not. You know we can go in canoes
up as far as the old coal wharf, and that’s a good
four miles above here.”</p>

<p>“We might swim it,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes, and get our clothes wet and have pneumonia,”
responded Alf. “I guess not. Come on,
then; we’ll foot it to the bridge.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s do something. I’m getting frozen.”
And Dan led the way back along the edge
of the river. When they had reached their picnic
site they stood for a moment around the dwindling
fire and warmed their chilled bodies.</p>

<p>“Let’s leave these things here,” suggested
Tom, “and come up for them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You can leave your rug if you want to,” replied
Alf, “but I prefer to take mine along. I
don’t care to lose it; it cost money.”</p>

<p>“That’s different, of course,” answered Tom
cheerfully. “They gave me mine with a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
suspenders. Nevertheless I cherish it deeply and
will e’en bear it with me.”</p>

<p>“They may keep us from freezing to death
before we get home,” said Dan morosely.</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t be cold by the time you reach
the bridge,” answered Tom. “All ready? Who’s
got the pesky glasses? You, Gerald? Give them
to me and I’ll stick ’em in my pockets. That’s
all right. Now, then, the bridge party will proceed.”</p>

<p>It was a rather silent quartet that tramped
along the river bank in the wind. Luckily they
were leaving the marshes behind, and, although
they did get their feet wet more than once, they
encountered no streams. The mile and a half
seemed nearer three, but that was no doubt due
to the fact that they had to stumble through
bushes and briars and force their way through
thickets.</p>

<p>“Was that one of the school canoes you had?”
asked Alf once.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dan replied sadly. “How much will
they charge me for it, do you think?”</p>

<p>“About twenty-five, I guess. Maybe it will
be found, though.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope so! You had your own, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, mine and Tom’s. I don’t care so much,
about that, though; I daresay I wouldn’t have
used it much more, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Let it go,” said Tom cheerfully. “It has
played us false.”</p>

<p>“You’re a queer dub,” said Dan, turning to
him with a smile. “Most of the time you don’t
open your mouth. To-day you’re real sort of
chatty. Adversity seems to agree with you, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t that,” was the reply. “It’s the
picnic. Picnics always make me bright and sunny.
I’m crazy about them and don’t know when I’ve
ever enjoyed one more. You—you get so close to
Nature, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“You surely do,” answered Dan, stumbling
over a blackberry runner and picking himself up
again. “Too close!”</p>

<p>“There’s the bridge!” cried Gerald from the
end of the procession.</p>

<p>“Praises be!” said Alf. “I only hope it will
hold together long enough for us to get across.
It looks as though it might tumble down any moment.”</p>

<p>“Never look a bridge in the mouth till you
come to it,” said Tom. “To me it is a most beautiful
structure, far, far more beautiful than the
Brooklyn Bridge or the Bridge of Sighs or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the <em>ponts</em> of dear old Paris. Don’t you love
the <em>ponts</em> of Paris, Dan?”</p>

<p>“I’m wild about plaster of Paris,” laughed
Dan as they reached the narrow road and turned
onto the old wagon bridge. Once across it they
continued along the road instead of following the
river back.</p>

<p>“The railroad’s only a little way over,” said
Alf, “and I’m sick of looking at that measly little
ditch.”</p>

<p>“Remember the rules, Alf,” cautioned Tom.
“No walking on the railroad, you know.”</p>

<p>“Hang the rules! I want to get home!”</p>

<p>“So do I, but not in pieces. I knew a fellow
once who was walking on the railroad and a train
came up behind him and he didn’t get off and—”
Tom paused eloquently.</p>

<p>“And cr-r-rushed him, I suppose,” Dan inquired.</p>

<p>“No, he was on the other track,” answered
Tom. “It’s always safer to be on the other
track. I shall walk on the other track all the way
home.”</p>

<p>“Tom, you’re a perfect idiot to-day,” said Alf
disgustedly. “You aren’t nearly as funny as you
think you are.”</p>

<p>“And you’re not nearly as grouchy as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
think you are,” replied Tom good-naturedly.
“Behold, gentlemen and one other, the railroad,
passing, as you see, from thither to yon; also
back again on the other track. How do we get
down there? Jump?”</p>

<p>“No, fall,” said Dan, scrambling down the
steep bank. “I want to tell you, though, that I’m
going to get out of here before I come in sight of
school. Old Toby is daffy about fellows walking
on the railroad tracks.”</p>

<p>“Hope we don’t meet him coming the other
way,” said Tom. “What would you do if we did,
Alf? Just whistle and speed by?”</p>

<p>“No, I’d jump the track and run like the
dickens,” answered Alf. “I wonder why they
don’t put these fool ties the same distance
apart.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good exercise,” said Dan. “How
are you getting on, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“All right,” Gerald replied a trifle breathlessly.
“I thought I heard a whistle then, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Old Toby, I’ll bet a hat!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, if a train comes,” answered Dan,
“don’t try to guess which track it’s on but get off
on one side as quick as you know how and give
it plenty of room.”</p>

<p>Gerald had a chance to profit by Dan’s advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a few minutes later when a local came screeching
down on them from the east. The boys drew off
at one side of the track and held onto their caps,
for the cut was narrow and the engine and cars
went by at not much more than arm’s length.</p>

<p>“That engine bit at me,” gasped Alf when the
last car had hurtled by in a blinding cloud of dust
and smoke. “Gee, but my eyes are full of cinders!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you shut them?” asked Tom.
“That was a narrow escape, fellows, I tell you.
A yard farther that way and we’d have been
ground to atoms.”</p>

<p>“I guess the next time I’ll climb the bank,”
observed Gerald with a somewhat sickly smile.
“I thought that engine was going to reach out
and grab me!”</p>

<p>“There probably won’t be any next time,” said
Dan. “Not if we foot it a little faster. What
time is it, anyway? By Jupiter, Alf, it’s a quarter
past four!”</p>

<p>“I’m automobiling this minute,” sighed Tom.
“Say, did we have any luncheon or did I just
dream it? I’m certainly terribly lonesome inside.”</p>

<p>“I could eat tacks,” said Alf. “Double-pointed
ones, too. Let’s hit up the pace a bit.”</p>

<p>They did, but soon tired, for the ties were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
never just where they should have been and progress
consisted of hops and skips and occasional
jumps. Tom voiced the general sentiment when
he observed pantingly: “Fellows, this is very
tie-some. I shall moderate my transports, if I
never get home.”</p>

<p>“You mean transportation,” suggested Dan.</p>

<p>“I mean that I’m going to walk the rest of
the way calmly and with dignity. This thing of
being a goat and leaping from crag to crag makes
me nervous. Anyway, we’re getting pretty near
school and I vote that we quit being railroad
trains and hit the road.”</p>

<p>“Road nothing! Come up this side and go
through the woods,” said Alf. “It’s a heap
nearer.”</p>

<p>So they climbed a steep bank, shinned over a
high fence and left the railroad cut. Ten minutes
of devious progress through woods and across
fields brought them to the school. Tom subsided
on the steps of Clarke.</p>

<p>“I can go no further,” he declared. “Bring
up the auto, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s gone home again,” said Gerald.
“But it isn’t too late to take a ride, is it?
Just a short one.”</p>

<p>“Ride! What is a ride?” demanded Alf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
“I’ve walked so much I can’t imagine doing anything
else.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and telephone home and ask them to
send the car back,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket. But, look here, what about
dressing? Do we get into our party rags now
or after the ride?”</p>

<p>“Afterwards,” said Gerald. “We’ll come back
at six and dinner isn’t until seven.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Alf. “I’ll just crawl over and
eradicate some of the signs of travel; and incidentally
get about a quart of cinders out of my
eyes. We’ll come up to the room in about ten
minutes, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Right O! I don’t think a little exercise with
a whisk broom and soap and water would hurt
me any, either. What’s this?”</p>

<p>“This,” answered Tom, “or rather, these, are
the glasses, Dan. I appoint you a committee of
one to restore them to the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“You run away and play! Take them back
yourself, you old lazy chump!”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t borrow them. They might not
like——”</p>

<p>“Neither did I. Give them to Alf.”</p>

<p>But Alf had already departed, and with a
groan Tom made his way to Whitson, limping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
pathetically. On the steps he paused and looked
back at Dan, who had watched the performance
amusedly. Tom raised the hand holding the tumblers
high in air.</p>

<p>“Picnic!” he called across. “Never again!”</p>

<small>BUILDING THE RINK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There may be better ways of putting one’s
self in condition to do justice to a Thanksgiving
Day dinner than paddling a mile and a half in a
canoe, walking five miles after that and finishing
up with a forty-mile ride in an automobile. If
there are, I can’t think of them at this moment.
And at all events never, surely, were four hungrier
boys ever gathered around a table than the
quartet that did full and ample justice to Mr.
Pennimore’s hospitality that evening. I shan’t go
into many details regarding that repast, for I
don’t want to make you envious, but it was an
old-fashioned Thanksgiving banquet, with oysters
from the host’s own oyster beds, a clear soup,
celery and olives, a turkey that, as Alf said,
would have been an ostrich if it had lived another
day or two, a roast ham that fell to pieces under
the carving knife, vegetables without end, a salad
that held most all the colors of the rainbow and
as many flavors, a pumpkin pie looking like a full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
harvest moon, ice cream and sherbet in the form
of turkeys seated on nests of yellow spun sugar,
little cakes with all shades of icing, black grapes
nearly as big as golf balls from the Sound View
conservatories, apples like the pictures in nursery
catalogues, oranges, pears, nuts and raisins and
candy. And there was all the sweet cider they
wanted, and, finally, black coffee and toasted
crackers and some cheese that Tom helped himself
to lavishly and afterwards viewed with deep
suspicion.</p>

<p>It was almost nine when the chairs were
pushed back and the diners adjourned to the big
crackling fire in the library. Tom lowered himself
cautiously into an armchair with a blissful
groan.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” he said, “that I shall want
to eat again until Christmas. I know now why
the Puritans used to go to church in the morning
on Thanksgiving Day. They never would
have had enough energy to give thanks after
dinner!”</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore led the talk around to subjects
nearest to the hearts of his guests and soon had
them chattering merrily of school and sports.
Tom begged him to come over some time and see
a basket ball game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d like to,” said Mr. Pennimore, “but you
know I close the house here to-morrow and go
back to New York. I hardly think I shall be in
Wissining again before spring. I’m sorry I can’t
see some of your winter sports, Tom.”</p>

<p>“You ought to see us lick Broadwood at
hockey,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Hockey? Let me see, we used to call that
shinny or shinty when I was a boy, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Alf explained the modern form of the game and
they talked over the outlook for the season. “I’m
going to get the team together in about a week,”
he said. “Sometimes we have fairly good ice before
Christmas, and when we don’t we can get a
lot of practice at shooting in the gym. I’m going
to try and make a goal out of Dan.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to play myself,” said Tom, “if Dan’s
going to be the goal. What’s he going to do?
Stand and hold his mouth open?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try for the team, too, sir,” said
Gerald importantly.</p>

<p>“Are you?” asked his father with a smile.
“Well, don’t get hurt, son. Ice is hard stuff to
fall on, and it seems to me that I recollect getting
hit once or twice on the shins with a stick. It
was rather painful, I believe.”</p>

<p>“It hurts like the dickens,” laughed Alf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
“And when your hands are cold and some one
raps them it feels as though they were busted.”</p>

<p>“What do you play for?” asked Mr. Pennimore.
“I mean what is the trophy?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any, sir. We just play for the
honor. Beating Broadwood is enough in itself.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. I was going to propose putting
a cup up. How would that do?”</p>

<p>“Great!” exclaimed Alf.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, dad!” said Gerald eagerly. “A
great big one!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think it’s necessary to have it
very big, is it, Alf? Suppose I offer a cup to be
played for for three years, the team winning
twice to take permanent possession. Would that
be a good plan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it would be a dandy idea,” answered
Alf with enthusiasm. “The team that won it this
year could keep it until next. It would be mighty
nice of you, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll attend to it when I get to town.
I’ll have the silversmith make a sketch and send
it down for you to pass on. I suppose he will
have some ideas on the subject.”</p>

<p>“How big would it be, sir?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll leave that to you boys. What do
you say, Alf?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think about eight inches high, sir;
a sort of a loving-cup effect.”</p>

<p>“They might work in some crossed hockey
sticks,” Dan suggested, “and the Yardley and
Broadwood flags.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a good idea. I’ll remember that.
You see what you think of the design that’s sent
you, Alf, and then write the firm and suggest any
changes you like. We’ll call it the—what shall
we call it?”</p>

<p>“The Pennimore Cup, sir,” answered Alf and
Tom in chorus.</p>

<p>“Hum; no, I’m not looking for glory. Let’s
call it the Sound View Cup. How will that do?”</p>

<p>“Pennimore Cup sounds better, sir,” said
Dan.</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” Alf agreed. “Let’s call it
that, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed their host. “I haven’t
any objection. The Pennimore Cup it is, then.
And I hope you fellows get it for good in
the end.”</p>

<p>“I hope we get it this year, anyway,” said Alf.
“I’ll get French—he’s our manager—to write
over and tell Broadwood about it. It ought to
please them.”</p>

<p>“It’ll please them so much,” murmured Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
sleepily, “that they’ll come over here and carry
it home with them.”</p>

<p>“If they do it will be after the hardest tussle
they ever had,” declared Alf. “We’re going to
have a hockey seven that will be a dandy!”</p>

<p>Dan and Alf and Tom said good night and
good-by at ten. Gerald, since his father was to
take his departure on the morrow, had obtained
permission to spend the night at Sound View.
The others shook hands with Mr. Pennimore on
the porch and then piled into the automobile and
were whisked home, a very tired and sleepy and
contented trio. By all the rules and laws of compensation
every last one of them ought to have
suffered that night with indigestion. But they
didn’t. Instead, they dropped into sound sleep as
soon as their heads touched the pillows and never
woke until the sunlight was streaming in at the
windows.</p>

<p>The lost canoes were recovered the next day.
Alf’s was found caught on a snag at the up-stream
end of Flat Island, Dan’s beached just below the
railroad bridge. Some one had evidently seen it
and pulled it ashore, thereby earning Dan’s deep
gratitude.</p>

<p>A few days later the candidates for the hockey
team were summoned to a meeting in the gymnasium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and Alf outlined the season’s plans to
them. Faculty had agreed to allow them a schedule
of eight games, with the Broadwood contest
closing the season on the twentieth of February.
The first game, with St. John’s, was arranged for
January ninth. Alf said he wanted the fellows to
put in every moment possible during the Christmas
recess on skates.</p>

<p>“Play hockey if you can. If you can’t, take a
hockey stick with you and learn to use it with
both hands. Buy a puck and try shooting, too.
Put a couple of sticks or stones on the ice and try
to shoot the puck between them. You ought all
of you to have a fair idea of hockey by the time
you get back to school. We have a few dollars
in the treasury already, but we are going to use
that to build a rink on the meadow. So every fellow
will have to buy his own sticks this year.
From now until vacation there will be practice
every afternoon but Saturdays in the baseball
cage or in the rowing room. Of course, if we get
ice we’ll go out of doors. You’d better each of
you buy a book of rules and study it. You can
get the book in Greenburg at Proctor’s, and it
costs you only ten cents. So don’t tell me you
can’t afford it. Any fellow who thinks that’s too
much money, however, can go to French and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
will buy the book for him. That’s all for this
time, I guess. Four o’clock Monday next here in
the gym.”</p>

<p>“Shall we wear skates?” some one inquired.</p>

<p>“You may wear roller skates if you have
them,” replied Alf, joining in the laughter. “We
don’t expect to learn to skate indoors, however,
simply to use the stick and shoot. By the way,
though, there is one more thing. We’ve got to
get the rink ready before the ground freezes.
We’re going to throw up embankments of earth
about a foot high. Mr. McCarthy has agreed to
do that for us, but he can only work at it an hour
or so a day. Now, suppose to-morrow afternoon
we all go down and give him a hand. We’d get it
done then and would save money, too; and we
need all the money we’ve got. What do you say?”</p>

<p>What they said was evident from the fact that
the next afternoon some thirty boys of various
ages and sizes were merrily throwing up the
ground with whatever implements they had been
able to requisition. Alf and Dan and Dick French
had marked off the ground and set stakes, and
before dark the rink was ready for the ground to
freeze.</p>

<p>“What I don’t just comprehend,” observed
Dan, as they stood in the twilight viewing the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with satisfaction, “is how you propose to get
the water in here. The river is about four feet
below the level of the rink.”</p>

<p>“Pump it, my dear boy. Mr. McCarthy has
a hand pump and he will rig it up over there on
the bank. Then we’ll build a trough effect of
boards and run the water into the rink.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dan, nodding. “When are you
going to do that?”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as the ground freezes hard.”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Lots. If the ground isn’t frozen the water
will seep into it about as fast as we run it on.
Comprehend?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Highness. It’s quite simple—when
you know it. Now let’s go to supper and
let it freeze.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do much freezing this sort of weather,”
said French. “Smells like snow, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know snow had any smell,” said Alf.
“What I’d like to do if we could afford it, fellows,
is to put planks around the sides.”</p>

<p>“How much would it cost?” asked French.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ll come down to-morrow,
though, and see how many planks it would take.
They wouldn’t need to be more than ten inches
broad. We could sink them two inches under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
ice and that would leave eight inches above to
stop the puck. You can do a lot better if you
have something for the puck to carrom off of. I
wish we had as good a rink as Broadwood has.”</p>

<p>“Maybe another year we can,” said French.
“If we turn out a good team this winter perhaps
the fellows will contribute toward fixing this up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I won’t be here,” laughed Alf. “And
I find that what is going to happen next year
doesn’t interest me as much as it ought to!”</p>

<p>With football over, the school settled for
awhile into a quiet untroubled by athletic excitement.
To be sure hockey and basket ball candidates
practiced busily, but there were no matches
to distract attention from study, which was an
excellent thing for many of the students, since
examination had begun to loom large on the horizon.
Gerald, whose attention had been greatly
distracted of late, was enabled to placate Mr. McIntyre
by greatly improving his class standing in
mathematics, a subject which held for him more
terrors than any other study.</p>

<p>At four o’clock every afternoon Dan donned
huge leg guards and gauntleted gloves, grasped
his broad stick and stood heroically in front of
the cage which Alf had set on the gymnasium
floor and did his best to stop the hard rubber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
disks that the others sent whizzing or hurtling at
him. He got many hard knocks at first, for a puck
can make one wince if it manages to come in contact
with an unprotected part of one’s anatomy,
and Dan had his moments of discouragement.
But Alf kept him at it.</p>

<p>“You’re doing finely,” he declared. “And
when we get out on the ice you’ll like it better.”</p>

<p>But they were not destined to get out on the
ice just then, for there wasn’t any ice. December
had apparently made up its mind to be an imitation
November. It snowed now and then, and the
mornings and evenings were nippy, and there
were plenty of cloudy, disagreeable days, but
really cold weather avoided the vicinity of Wissining
until Christmas vacation arrived. Meanwhile
the only event to disturb the even tenor of
existence at Yardley was the Winter Debate between
Oxford and Cambridge Societies. This
came two days before the end of the term and for
a week ahead excitement ran high. Every fellow
displayed either the light blue of Cambridge or
the dark blue of Oxford and enthusiasm bubbled
over. No one that we know very well took part
for either side. Nor do I remember now the subject
for debate. But I do know that it was very
weighty, and that Cambridge had the negative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
side, and that the judges, Messrs. Fry, Austin
and Gaddis, of the faculty, remained out quite
awhile before rendering their verdict. Tom said
this was to avoid having to listen to the efforts
of the Glee and Banjo Clubs, but Tom was insufferable
that evening, anyhow. He sat with
Dan and Alf and Gerald and applauded Oxford’s
speakers vehemently and groaned whenever a
Cambridge man opened his mouth. He pretended
that there was no possibility of doubt as to
the result.</p>

<p>“It’s all Oxford,” he declared smugly. “We
beat you on logic and eloquence. We have proved
conclusively that—that—well, whatever it was is
so. You haven’t a leg to stand on. The affirmative
wins all along the line.”</p>

<p>“You wait until you hear from the jury,” said
Alf darkly. “You fellows had the poorest lot of
debaters that ever driveled. Why, that second
speaker of yours didn’t know the subject! Just
worked a lot of musty jokes, and——”</p>

<p>But at that moment the judges returned to the
hall, the Glee Club cut off the last verse of the
song they were struggling with and Mr. Austin
advanced smilingly to the front of the platform.</p>

<p>“Good old Stevie,” murmured Tom. “He
knows!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and you’ll know in a minute,” whispered
Dan.</p>

<p>That wasn’t literally correct, for Mr. Austin
had several things to say before he announced the
verdict. In Alf’s language, he walked around the
stump a dozen times. He said nice things about
Cambridge and nice things about Oxford. He
complimented each speaker and indulged in a few
criticisms. And finally he awarded the victory to
Oxford!</p>

<p>Wearers of the dark blue arose and made
Rome howl. Tom also arose, pulling down his
vest and assuming the air of virtue triumphant,
but he sat down again very forcibly, and Dan and
Alf vented their disappointment on him until he
was glad to subside from the settee and beg
mercy from the floor. As they were in the back
of the hall, and as nothing they might have done
could have been heard above the noise, they made
Tom perjure himself over and over; made him
declare that Cambridge had won the debate fairly,
without a shadow of a doubt, that the judges
were biased, ignorant and mendacious, that he
personally didn’t know oratory from a ham sandwich,
and that Cambridge was the greatest debating
society the world had ever known. Then,
after he had cheered for Cambridge—twice, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the first time he had spoiled the effect by
giggling—they allowed him to get up. Somehow
in the operation of arising he managed to upset
the bench backward, and in the subsequent confusion
they departed hurriedly from the hall.</p>

<p>Two days later school was depopulated of all
save a few boys who lived too far away to travel
home for vacation and who had not been invited
to spend the ten days with friends. Gerald, Tom,
Alf and Dan traveled together as far as New
York. Gerald remained there, while Tom crossed
to his home in New Jersey and Dan accompanied
Alf to Philadelphia. Dan’s own home was in
Ohio, and as the trip there and back would have
spoiled four of the precious days of vacation, he
had gladly accepted Alf’s invitation to visit him.</p>

<small>THE HOCKEY TEAM AT WORK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A gray day, still and cold. The river winding
away into the misty distance, a green ribbon of
glaring ice. A thin powder of crisp snow over the
frozen earth and a feeling in the air as of more
to come. From the buildings on the hill the smoke
rises straight up, blue-gray against the neutral
tint of the sky. From the rink by the river comes
the sound of voices ringing sharply on the motionless
air and the metallic clanging and scraping
of skates on the hard ice. The Yardley
Hockey Team is at practice. School has been
open a week and, although St. John’s has fallen
victim to the prowess of the blue-stockinged
skaters by the score of two goals to none, Alf is
far from satisfied with the work of his charges
and to-day that much abused word “strenuous”
best describes what is going on.</p>

<p>Alf has got his boards and an eight-inch barrier
surrounds the rink, the planks being nailed
to stakes driven into the ground and their lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
edges frozen solid in the margin of the ice. Beyond
the boards is a retaining wall of earth some
eighteen inches high from the top of which at the
present moment some twenty or thirty spectators,
well wrapped against the cold, are watching practice.
Two benches, borrowed from the tennis
courts, are piled with sweaters and extra paraphernalia.</p>

<p>At this end of the rink, his knees bent behind
the big padded leg guards and his body unconsciously
following, with his eyes, every move of
the puck, stands Dan, one hand resting on the top
of the goal and the other grasping his broad
stick. In front of him Alf is poised at point.
Then comes Felder at cover point. The forwards
just at present are inextricably mixed
with the Second Team players, but three of them
you know by sight at least; Goodyear and Roeder
playing the centers of the line and Durfee at
right end. The left end is Hanley, a Second
Class boy.</p>

<p>The Second Team consists to-day of Norcross
at goal, Sommers at point, Coke at cover point,
and Dick French, Arthur Thompson, Dickenson,
and Longwell as forwards. Along the barrier are
the substitutes of both teams, three of whom we
know; Gerald Pennimore and Eisner and Ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of the football eleven. Dickenson is captain and
under his leadership the Second is putting up a
strong game these days. Along the side of the
rink, following the play, skates Andy Ryan, his
twinkling green eyes ever watching for off-side
play and his whistle ever ready to signal a cessation
of hostilities. It does so now, and the players
pause and lean panting on their sticks while
Andy captures the puck. Dickenson and Roeder
face-off, the puck is dropped and play begins
again. Dickenson captures the puck, and the Second’s
line is quickly formed to sweep down the
rink. Dickenson passes clear across to French.
Hanley checks him for an instant, but he recovers
the disk and slides it across to Arthur. Then
the First Team’s defense takes a hand. Felder
hurls himself at Arthur, but the puck slips aside
just in the nick of time, and Dickenson, whirling
about a half-dozen yards from goal, eludes
Hanley and shoots. Alf has been put out of the
play by Longwell and the puck skims by him
knee-high, and in spite of Dan’s efforts with stick
and body lodges cosily in a corner of the net.
The attack waves its sticks wearily and turns back
up the ice as Andy blows his whistle. The score
is three to two now in favor of the First, and
there remains but a few minutes of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
half. Gerald, who has been appointed timekeeper,
announces the fact from the side. So
both teams put in their substitutes, and Gerald,
eagerly handing the stop-watch over to Goodyear,
pulls his ulster off and leaps the boards.
Besides Goodyear, Felder, Durfee, and Roeder retire
from the First. Sanderson takes Felder’s
place, and Eisner, Gerald, and Ridge play forward.</p>

<p>The puck goes back to the center of the ice,
Dickenson and Ridge face-off, the whistle blows
and the struggle begins again. Back comes the
rubber to Goodyear and down the rink sweep the
First’s line, low and hard, the puck traveling
back and forth across the powdered surface.
Down goes Ridge with a crash and a splintered
stick, but the remaining three are still line-abreast.
Then the Second’s cover point flies out,
there is a wild mêlée in front of goal, and away
skims the puck. Gerald reaches it, but is quickly
shouldered across the barrier, and Dickenson
steals away toward the First’s goal, the disk sliding
along easily at the point of his stick. Eisner
flies to challenge him, Dickenson passes too late,
and once more the First is sweeping toward the
enemy’s goal. Hanley passes to Ridge ten yards
from the net and Ridge, eluding the opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
point, carries the puck on, with Eisner close behind
him. Sticks clash and skates grind; Eisner
goes down carrying Sommers with him; the puck
flies here and there in front of goal; and then
Gerald, slipping in between the battling players,
reaches the rubber with the tip of his stick and,
before he is swept aside, slides it past the goal-tender’s
foot. Andy’s whistle announces a
score and stops play.</p>

<p>“Good work, Gerald!” cries Alf from down
the rink.</p>

<p>“Time’s up!” announces Goodyear.</p>

<p>“Let’s have another five minutes, Andy,”
Dickenson begs. But Andy shakes his head.</p>

<p>“You’ve had enough. You’re tired. That’s
all to-day.”</p>

<p>The spectators hurry away up the hill in the
gathering twilight, and the players, after removing
their skates and donning coats and sweaters,
follow by ones and twos and threes, discussing
the play, explaining and arguing. The talk lasts
all through the subsequent half hour in the gymnasium
while the shower baths are hissing, while
bruises are being examined by the watchful trainer
and while the boys are getting into their clothes
again. By this time appetites are at top-notch,
and anyone who has ever played two fifteen-minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
halves of a hockey game after a half-hour’s
practice on a cold afternoon will know why.</p>

<p>The first number of the <cite>Scholiast</cite> issued after
the beginning of the new term contained a schedule
of the Hockey’s Team’s contests, and all
agreed that French had done his work well. St.
John’s was followed by Greenburg High School
on the 13th. Then came Carrel’s School on the
17th, Warren Hall on the 23d, and the Yale
Freshmen on the 30th. Nordham came on February
6th, Rock Hill College on the 13th, and the
season ended with the Broadwood game on
the 20th.</p>

<p>They talked it over that night in 7 Dudley, Alf
and Tom and Dan. It was a cold, windy night,
the steam pipes were chugging and there was a
glowing coal fire in the grate. The three boys
had pulled their chairs close to the hearth and
were toasting their knees comfortably. Examinations
had begun, and it had been a hard day
for all of them, but they had each weathered the
perils and now were enjoying their reward.</p>

<p>“Did you read this?” asked Tom, holding up
his copy of the <cite>Scholiast</cite>.</p>

<p>“Joe’s editorial?” asked Dan lazily. “Yes.
Great, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It ought to make a big hit with faculty,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
said Alf. “I love that about ‘a realization of our
duty toward those who have patiently and tirelessly
sought to instill into our minds the knowledge
which in after years—in after years—’
I’ve forgotten the rest. But it’s perfectly scrumptious!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe’s a wonder when he rumples his hair
and looks wild-eyed,” said Tom. “He will make
Horace Greeley and the rest of our great journalists
look like base imitations when he gets
started. Did you see the hockey schedule, Alf?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and for a wonder they got it right. It’s
a pretty good schedule, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but when I think of how many bruises
I got in the St. John’s game and then multiply
them by the number of games to come my courage
fails. I guess I’ll be a fit candidate for the infirmary
about the middle of the season.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” laughed Alf, “you’ll soon learn to get
the puck with your hand instead of your body.
It’s a great mistake to try and stop it with your
head, Dan.”</p>

<p>Dan felt of a lump just over his forehead.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right; especially since if I had
got out of the way of that one it would have gone
out of the rink, whereas by stopping it with my
head it fell in front of goal, and some malicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
idiot knocked it in before I had stopped studying
astronomy!”</p>

<p>“Accidents will happen,” remarked Tom
sagely.</p>

<p>“You bet they will! And I’m going to take
out an accident policy. I’m beginning to look like
a tattooed man, I’m so full of nice little black and
blue and yellow spots! I can tell you one thing,
Alfred Loring, and that is that if I had known
that playing goal was the next thing to being
trampled underfoot by an automobile or a trolley
car you could have looked somewhere else for a
victim!”</p>

<p>“I should think he would want to play the position
himself,” said Tom. “It’s the most responsible
position on the team and I think a captain
ought to occupy it, don’t you, Dan?”</p>

<p>“I wish he would for a while,” answered Dan,
with enthusiasm. “As it is, I stand there with
my eyes popping out of my head while what
seem to be about fifty fellows come charging
down on me with the puck doing a shuttle act
in front of them. I try to watch the puck and the
players at the same time and resolve to sell my
life dearly. Then, just when they are on me, Alf
here dashes gloriously into the fray, always trying
to check the man who hasn’t had the puck for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
five minutes. They just open up and let him
through—or they put out a stick and he does a
double tumble—and they proceed to try and kill
the goal-tend.”</p>

<p>“And usually succeed,” said Tom with a grin.
“I’ve played goal myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they usually have plenty of fun with
me, whether they get the puck in or not. I try
to make myself big enough to cover the whole
opening, but I can’t do it. So I dodge around
from this side to that and do a sort of war dance
on my skates and flourish my stick about. And
all that time they’re rapping me on the hands and
banging my ankles, and the puck looks like twenty
pucks and is all over the shop. And usually Alf
is lying on his back on the ice yelling, ‘Get it
away from there! Get it away from there!’”</p>

<p>Alf joined in the laugh. “Well, Dan,” he said,
“you see I play point, and the point is to keep
out of danger.”</p>

<p>“That’s a sorry jest,” groaned Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s worse than that,” said Dan. “How’s
basket ball getting on, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy,” Tom answered. “We do
up Broadwood a week from Saturday; first game,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Here or at Broadwood?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here. And, say, you chaps, can’t you come
along to New York with us on the thirtieth? It’s
our first trip to the metropolis and we’re feeling
sort of stuck up about it. Collins wouldn’t think
of it at first, but I showed him that we could
leave here in the morning and get back for supper;
so he consented.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we can’t, Tom,” said Alf, “for we
have an engagement right here that afternoon.
The Yale Freshmen play us, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; I’d forgotten. Well, you can
howl for us when we play Broadwood. We’ve
got a pretty good team this year, Alf. That chap,
Short, is the best center we’ve ever had.”</p>

<p>“Short? He’s the fellow played substitute
last year, isn’t he?” Alf asked. “A little sawed-off
about six feet high?”</p>

<p>“That’s the man,” laughed Tom. “There’s
nothing short about him except his name. He
doesn’t really have to throw the ball into the basket;
he just reaches up and drops it in!”</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door, and in response
to the dual shout of “Enter, thou!” from
Alf and Tom, Gerald appeared.</p>

<p>“Greetings, Mr. Pennimore!” cried Alf.
“Kindly close the door behind you and remove
your wraps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald had no wraps to remove, however, and
Dan got after him. “You ought to know better
than to run around without even a sweater, Gerald.
You’ll catch cold and have pneumonia or
something the first thing you know.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t cold, really,” protested Gerald,
blowing on his fingers as he took the chair Alf
had pulled to the fire.</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense,” returned Dan sternly. “It
isn’t smart to do things like this, Gerald. It’s
just taking risks.”</p>

<p>Alf winked gravely at Tom.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I haven’t any children,” he murmured.
“Well, Gerald, how do you like hockey?”</p>

<p>“Very much, only—I don’t get much chance
to play, Alf.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get in for a while this afternoon,
kid?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just for about three or four minutes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must remember that there are
quite a few fellows who have played longer than
you have, Gerald. Besides, if you will pardon
personalities, you are just a little bit light.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” agreed Gerald mournfully.
“If I was only about twenty pounds heavier I’d
be all right.” He looked wonderingly at the
others as they laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re all right as you are,” answered Alf
heartily. “We’ll make a hockey player of you
yet. But I don’t honestly think, Gerald, that you
need expect to make the First much before next
year.”</p>

<p>Gerald’s face fell, and his disappointment was
so evident that Tom tried to break the force of
the blow.</p>

<p>“Anyway, Gerald, you’ve had pretty near
enough glory for one year, haven’t you? Making
the Cross-Country Team and winning the meet
with Broadwood was going some for a youngster.”</p>

<p>“But they don’t give you your Y for that,”
said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s it?” said Alf. “Well, you
mustn’t think about such things, kid. You must
always play for the School with no thought of
reward.” He looked gravely at Tom. Tom
grinned.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you think about getting your Y when
you began to play football?” asked Gerald suspiciously.
Alf cleared his throat, and Tom and
Dan laughed.</p>

<p>“We-ll, now you’re getting personal,” he replied
evasively. “I won’t say the thought didn’t
occur to me—for a moment—now and then, Gerald,
but—er—theoretically——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, forget it,” said Tom. “Don’t talk nonsense.
Half the fun is in winning your letter. I
was as proud as a peacock when I got mine.
They gave them out one afternoon and the next
morning I was wearing it on my cap.”</p>

<p>“How did you get it?” asked Gerald eagerly.</p>

<p>“Throwing the hammer.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I could do that, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” laughed the other. “But I
tell you what you might do, Gerald. You might
come out with the track team in the spring and
try running the mile. I wouldn’t be surprised if
you could do that distance pretty well. You’ve
got a mighty nice stride, son.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to try it,” said Gerald thoughtfully.
“I believe I could run the mile rather well.”</p>

<p>“Gerald, you are certainly getting a good
opinion of yourself,” said Dan dryly. “Have you
considered pitching for the nine this year?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll bet I could learn to pitch,” answered
Gerald untroubledly. “I know how to
throw the out drop and the in drop now.”</p>

<p>“You might mention that to Durfee,” said
Dan. “Meanwhile I’m going to my downy.” He
arose and limped exaggeratedly toward the door.
“Say, Alf, does the hockey management supply
liniment? If it does I’d like to make arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
for about six gallons to take me through the season.
Come on, Gerald. If you think you’ll be
too warm going back you might take your coat
over your arm.”</p>

<p>“Dan, you’re peevish to-night,” said Alf.
“You’ll feel better to-morrow after you’ve stopped
a few hot ones with your head.”</p>

<p>“And after I’ve taken two more exams. How
did you get on to-day, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“All right, I think,” replied Gerald cheerfully.
“When does the track team begin work, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind about track work,” said
Dan, hustling him out by the nape of his neck.
“You come home and do some studying. Good
night, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Mr. Grouch!”</p>

<p>At the outer door Dan turned to Gerald: “Now
you run like the dickens all the way across. If
you don’t I’ll rub your face with snow. And another
time if I catch you parading around in this
weather with nothing on——”</p>

<p>But Gerald was already racing across the
yard for Clarke.</p>

<p>January dragged past and examinations came
to an end with no serious results for any of these
in whom we are interested. The hockey team defeated
Greenburg easily, lost to Carrel’s school,
3 to 7, won from Warren Hall, 18 to 2, and finished
the month with a well-played game in which
the Yale Freshmen took its measure to the tune
of 12 to 4. All the month the ice remained in perfect
condition, although the team was kept pretty
busy shoveling snow from the rink. Dan had
settled down into his game at goal and, while he
still pretended that Alf had persuaded him to
join the team in the hope of having him killed, he
enjoyed it all hugely and was fast developing into
a strong and steady player. Gerald still adorned
the edge of the ice most of the time, although
in the Warren game he played part of one half
and, being opposed to fellows not much heavier
than he, played rather well and had two goals to
his credit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Basket ball had its devotees and regularly
twice a week Yardley met an opponent. So far
Tom’s team had been defeated but twice and had
played seven games. The first Broadwood game
had resulted in a tie at 17 to 17, although three
extra periods had been played. Yardley had won
the second contest at Broadwood by a decisive
score, 22 to 12, and the third meeting, which it
was hoped would decide the championship, was
due in a week. Gerald was the only one of our
friends who accompanied the basket ball team to
New York on the thirtieth. It had been his custom
since Thanksgiving to spend Sunday in the
city with his father, and as there was no hope of
his getting into the hockey game with the Yale
Freshmen that afternoon, he elected to accompany
Tom and the team to New York. The team met
defeat after a hard battle and from the up-town
gymnasium, in which the contest had taken place,
Gerald walked down to his home, only a few
blocks distant. When he returned to school early
Monday morning February had arrived with
mild weather. The next day, under the influence
of a south wind and warm sunlight, the ice on the
rink began to soften and rot, and, although the
team managed to hold practice that afternoon, it
proved to be the last for over a week. The Nordham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
game, set for the sixth, had to be cancelled
and Alf went around like a bear with a sore
head.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the Pennimore Cup
arrived. Alf and Dan and Gerald walked down
to the express office one noon and bore it back in
triumph. They opened the box in Dan’s room,
and after sprinkling the floor with excelsior, drew
the cup from its flannel bag and viewed it with
delight. It was of silver, some ten inches in
height and most elaborately designed. On one
side, in relief, were three figures of hockey players
scrimmaging for the puck. On the other side
was the raised inscription “Pennimore Cup for
Hockey—Won By,” and below it a shield for recording
the winners’ names. There were two
curving handles in the form of hockey sticks and
flag poles from which the rival banners of Yardley
and Broadwood swept away around the rim
of the cup. The inside was gilded and there was
an ebony base to set it on. They placed it on the
table and gazed at it enrapturedly.</p>

<p>“It’s the handsomest cup I ever saw!” said
Dan.</p>

<p>“It’s a—a peach!” said Alf. “Gerald, your
dad was certainly good to us.”</p>

<p>“I wish he could see it,” murmured Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“He will, for it’s going to stay right here at
Yardley,” declared Alf. “We’ve just <em>got</em> to win
that, Dan!”</p>

<p>“You bet we have!”</p>

<p>“You look after it to-night and to-morrow
we’ll take it over to Greenburg and get Proctor to
exhibit it in his window for a week or so; that
will give the Broadwood fellows a chance to see
it.”</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll never get a better chance,”
said Dan.</p>

<p>News of the trophy’s arrival was soon about
school and during the evening there was a steady
stream of visitors invading No. 28, and the following
day Alf and Gerald and Dan took the cup
to Greenburg and arranged with the amiable Mr.
Proctor to place it in his window. Mr. Proctor
conducted the principal book and stationery store
and held the trade of both schools. Alf wrote an
explanatory card to be placed with the cup: “Pennimore
Cup, the gift of Mr. John T. Pennimore,
to be contested for at hockey by Broadwood and
Yardley, and to become the permanent possession
of the school winning two out of three games.”
Then they went out on the sidewalk and blocked
traffic while they had a good look at it.</p>

<p>“Bet you that will make Broadwood’s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
stick out,” said Alf. “Let’s wait here awhile until
some Broadwoods come along and hear what
they say.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose they’d know who you are,
you silly chump?” laughed Dan. “Come on
home.”</p>

<p>“Not until I’ve had a hot chocolate,” returned
Alf firmly, moving away from the window with a
lingering look at the silver cup. “Want one? My
treat.”</p>

<p>“In that case we’ll each take two,” answered
Dan.</p>

<p>“I’ll have an egg-and-chocolate,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Dan innocently. “Is it more?”</p>

<p>“You dry up or you won’t get anything,” said
Alf as he ushered them through the door of the
drug store. “Two hot chocolates and an egg-and-chocolate,
please,” he announced to the clerk at
the fountain.</p>

<p>“Hold on a bit,” interrupted Dan soberly. “I
haven’t decided what mine is.” He looked about
at the signs dangling in front of him. “‘Walnut
Fudge Sundæ’; what do you suppose that is,
Alf?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it’s too cold for ice-cream
things.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Let me see, then. ‘Hot Malted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Milk’; that won’t do; I had to take that once when
I had a cold and the doctor wouldn’t let me eat
real food.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hurry up, can’t you?” begged Alf.
“Have a hot choc——”</p>

<p>“Ah! There it is, I’ll bet! ‘Hot Celery
Wine’; sounds wicked, doesn’t it? Hot Celery
Wine’s the drink for mine; it’s strong and fine
and makes you shine——”</p>

<p>“Give it to him!” Alf exploded. “Give him
a fried egg with it and let him have a real party!”</p>

<p>“No, no, I guess Hot Celery Wine would be
too strong. I’ll have a hot chocolate.”</p>

<p>The clerk, visibly amused, served the order
and added a little dish of sweet crackers, and the
boys removed their repast to one of the small
tables near by from where they could view the
street through the big window.</p>

<p>“There are some Broadwoods now,” said Alf,
“looking at the cup. I’d like to hear what they’re
saying.” Dan leaned past him so that he could
see Proctor’s window.</p>

<p>“The big fellow is Rhodes, their full back,”
he said. “Here come a couple of them over here.”</p>

<p>The two Broadwood fellows entered, ordered
raspberry college ices, and sat down at a table a
few feet distant. They had recognized Alf at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
once and possibly Dan, but they strove to hide
the fact.</p>

<p>“What did you think of it?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Oh, not so bad,” was the reply. “Of course
it isn’t really silver; you can see that quick
enough.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied the other scornfully.
“Probably tin, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Or pewter. They’re using pewter a good
deal for cups.”</p>

<p>“Ugly shape, isn’t it? I suppose, though, that
Yardley thinks it’s quite wonderful. I guess they
don’t see many cups over there.”</p>

<p>They laughed softly and bent over their ices
in order to exchange glances. Gerald was angry
clean through and Alf was scowling into the bottom
of his glass.</p>

<p>“Who’s this fellow Pennimore?” asked one
of the Broadwood lads.</p>

<p>“He’s a rich guy that lives over on the point.
He’s got a son at Yardley. The kid tried to get
into Broadwood but couldn’t pass, and they say the
old man promised to pay off the school debt at
Yardley if they’d take the kid. Anyhow, he’s there.”</p>

<p>Gerald set his glass down and started to his
feet with blazing cheeks, but Dan’s hand went out
and caught his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” said Dan firmly. “You sit
down again.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“You sit down!” Gerald obeyed. Alf had
stopped frowning. He finished his chocolate,
wiped his lips with the little paper napkin and
leaned across smilingly to Dan.</p>

<p>“You and Gerald walk to the door,” he said
softly, “and be ready to get away quick.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to touch them, if that’s
what you mean,” answered Alf. “Go ahead and
I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>Dan and Gerald arose and sauntered toward
the door, the Broadwood boys observing them uneasily,
although defiantly. Alf took up the three
empty glasses and started toward the counter.
To reach it he had to pass the table occupied by
the Broadwood fellows, and as he did so he stumbled,
fell against the table and sent the college
ices to the tiled floor where the cups broke and
their contents splashed about for yards. One of
the boys saved the table from going over and both
jumped angrily to their feet.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” answered Alf indifferently, “but you
ought to keep your feet out of the way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Our feet weren’t in your way! You did it
on purpose!”</p>

<p>“How absurd,” said Alf haughtily, as the
clerk hurried up with towels. “As though I
would intentionally upset the table. I have more
respect for cups than you have.”</p>

<p>He sauntered over to the counter, set his
glasses down and joined Dan and Gerald at the
door. The Broadwood boys were excitedly explaining
to the proprietor who had followed his
clerk to the scene. Dan and Gerald and Alf
slipped quietly out of the door, trying hard to
keep sober countenances. But once out of sight
of the window they hugged each other ecstatically
and laughed to their heart’s content.</p>

<p>“They’ll have to pay for damages,” gurgled
Alf, “and I’ll bet they haven’t got fifty cents between
them!”</p>

<p>“Maybe Wallace will get after us for it,” said
Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he won’t. He isn’t taking any
chances. He’s got those chaps and he knows he
may not see us again. Besides, he wouldn’t suspect
for a moment that I’d do a thing like that on
purpose! Perish the thought! First bloodshed
in the conflict for the Pennimore Cup results in
a Yardley victory! Ex-tra! Ex-tra!”</p>

<small>THE BASKET BALL GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dan opened the window and thrust his head
out.</p>

<p>“The enemy approaches,” he announced. Below
him, up the hill, approached the Broadwood
barge, its lamps boring holes in the darkness.
He could hear the straining of the horses, the
crunch of wheels on the gravel and the voices of
the occupants. “What time is it?” he asked,
closing the window again with a shiver.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five to eight,” replied Gerald, laying
his book down with an expression of relief.
“Let’s go over.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit early. We’ll walk over and get Alf
first. Put your coat on, chum. It’s as cold as
they make it to-night.”</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the three of them
were sitting in the front row of the balcony at the
gymnasium doing their share of the cheering
which had burst forth as the Yardley Basket Ball
Team had trotted onto the floor. Broadwood appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a moment later and for ten minutes the
baskets quivered under the assaults of the balls
as the players danced back and forth and shot at
goal. The cheering kept up, for everyone was in
high spirits at the prospect of a decisive victory
over Broadwood in the final contest. Broadwood
had sent a dozen or two supporters who had congregated
at one corner of the floor and were heroically
encouraging their team. At a few minutes
past eight the referee, athletic director of the
Greenburg Y. M. C. A., called the teams together.
Goals were chosen and the Blue and the Green arranged
themselves about the floor. Up went the
ball in the ring and Short, stretching his long arm
high in air, tipped it back to Tom. A pass across
the floor, a second pass to a waiting guard, a step
forward and an easy toss and the ball dropped
through Yardley’s basket for the first score in
something under two seconds. Yardley cheered
and stamped and a black 2 appeared on the board
opposite the Y.</p>

<p>Two more easy baskets followed before Broadwood
pulled herself together. Then her defense
covered closer and, although Yardley pushed the
war into the enemy’s territory time and again
during the succeeding ten minutes, she was unable
to add to the 6 she had secured. Short’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
ability at center handicapped Broadwood, for
that tall youth was able, nine times out of ten,
to put the ball in any direction he pleased.
Usually it went to Tom, who played right forward,
and who was so quick and certain at passing
that the ball was under Yardley’s goal before
the defense was aware of it. But after the
first ten minutes of play Broadwood’s captain
worked an improvement in the work of his team.
They covered better and Tom found that his opponent
had taken on the semblance of a leech and
was always at his elbow, no matter how hard he
tried to shake him off. Broadwood made her first
score from a free try after a Yardley player had
been detected holding and the little knot of Blue
adherents in the corner cheered lustily. That 1
on the board seemed to bring encouragement and
the Green set to work furiously. A long and
lucky shot from almost the middle of the floor
brought cries of approval from even the Yardley
throng and made the score 6 to 3.</p>

<p>The play was roughing up a good deal and
presently a double foul was called. Yardley
failed at her attempt and Broadwood succeeded,
and again the score changed.</p>

<p>“Come on, now!” called Tom. “Stop that
fouling and get busy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>In response Yardley worked through the
Broadwood defense by pretty team work and
scored again, but that was the last basket of the
period and the twenty minutes ended with the
figures on the board 8 to 4 in favor of the home
team.</p>

<p>During the ten minutes intermission Yardley
amused herself singing songs, while from the floor
at intervals came faintly the sound of Broadwood’s
cheers.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a good margin to begin the next
half on,” said Alf contentedly. “But it doesn’t
look to me that Tom’s aggregation of world
beaters is quite up to form. What do you think,
Dan?”</p>

<p>“They’re slow. Tom’s been driving them all
the way. We haven’t got this old game yet, Alf.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have it all right. Here they come.”</p>

<p>Broadwood had made two changes in her team
and the changes worked for the better. The new
men were lighter in weight but far speedier, and,
moreover, they were fresh and untired. From
the start of the last half the Blue began to overhaul
her rival. The 4 changed to a 6, and then
to an 8, and the score was tied. Over the edge
of the balcony hung a fringe of shouting, gesticulating
red-faced youths. A foul was called on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Broadwood and Yardley led by one point. Then
followed a long and desperate throw by a Yardley
forward which in some miraculous way got
through the basket.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, fellows!” shouted Tom,
racing back to his position and fighting off his
too-affectionate opponent. “We’ve got them on
the run now! Play it up!”</p>

<p>For once Short missed the toss and the ball
sped away toward a Broadwood forward. The
center raced down the floor as the ball came back
to him. A Yardley guard dived toward him, the
center feinted and let him go sprawling by. Short
engaged him from behind and for a moment gave
him all he could do. Then a Blue youth eluded
his man, took the ball at a short pass and threw
it backwards and over his head for one of the
prettiest goals of the evening.</p>

<p>For some reason that appeared to demoralize
Yardley. She fought desperately and wildly, but
her men forgot team play and it was everyone
for himself. Tom begged and commanded, but
dissolution had the team. Twice Broadwood
scored from the floor because the Yardley defense,
over-anxious, had allowed itself to be coaxed
away from goal, and twice she won points from
free tries. If she had thrown all the baskets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Yardley’s penalties allowed she would have had
several more figures to her credit. Toward the
end of the period Tom, hopeless of bringing back
order to his team, took things into his own hands
in a desperate effort to retrieve the day. Twice
he scored almost unaided and the shouts from the
balcony crashed against the walls. But Broadwood,
aware now of her superiority, played together
like well-drilled soldiers and score after
score followed. During the last five minutes it
was a veritable rout and when the bell clanged
the score was Yardley, 15, Broadwood, 27, and
down on the floor a group of delighted youths were
doing a dance and trying hard to cheer a hole
through the roof.</p>

<p>Dan and Alf and Gerald waited for Tom and
walked back to Dudley with him. Tom was disappointed
but philosophical.</p>

<p>“We simply went to pieces,” he said. “It
was every fellow on his own hook with us in the
second half, while Broadwood played together
like veterans, which most of them are. If we’d kept
up our team play we could have tied them or won.
I guess these little things have to happen, though,
and, after all, she hasn’t beaten us in the series.”</p>

<p>“Will you play her again, Tom?” asked Gerald
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d like to, but faculty won’t let us. No, it’s
a stand-off this year. We’ll get back at them next
year, though. They’re pretty sure to make Short
captain, and he’s a good player and has a head
on his shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Well, we mustn’t expect to win all down the
line,” said Dan comfortingly. “We beat at football
and cross-country and we have a good show
at baseball.”</p>

<p>“Not to speak of hockey,” added Alf.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the track meet?” inquired
Tom. “I’ll bet we’ll simply freeze her out
this spring. Why, we’ve got all the sprints and
most of the field events cinched.”</p>

<p>“And Gerald is going to run in the mile,” said
Alf. “So you can add that, too.”</p>

<p>“I really am going to try,” said Gerald earnestly.
“Tom says I can make the team, even if
I don’t win points.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Alf, with a wink at Dan.
“That’s an easy way to get your Y. Look at
Tom. He’d never have got it any other way!”</p>

<p>“He’s got it in three things,” said Gerald enviously.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just because when you once win
it nobody cares how many more you get,” said
Alf carelessly. “It’s like shinning up a tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
After you get to the first branch the rest is
easy.”</p>

<p>“I—I wish I could get to the first branch
then,” laughed Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh, you will. Just keep on shinning.”</p>

<p>That day the warm spell had disappeared, and
when Dan and Gerald returned to Clarke there
was a bitter northwest wind blowing.</p>

<p>“This means plenty of ice to-morrow,” said
Dan.</p>

<p>The ice was there, but it was in such rough
shape that it was necessary to re-flood the rink
sufficiently to get a new surface, and instead of
hockey practice on Monday afternoon the team
had manual labor. Unfortunately Mr. McCarthy’s
pump had given out, and so, after some study of
the problem, Alf organized a bucket brigade. It
was cold work dipping water from a hole in the
river ice and carrying it by pailfuls a good thirty
yards to the nearer corner of the rink. The water
froze around the rim of the buckets and the
ice had to be knocked away after every third or
fourth trip. And it was hard on hands, too. But
there were twenty odd boys in the brigade, each
with a bucket, and at last the old surface was
flooded over. That was on Monday, and on the
following Saturday was to come the last game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
before the Broadwood contest and Alf was impatient
to get back to practice. The enforced idleness
showed its effect the next afternoon. Muscles
were stiff, ankles weak and the fellows went at
their work in a slow and half-hearted way that
aroused the captain’s ire.</p>

<p>“If you fellows don’t want to play,” he declared
sarcastically, “just say so and I’ll let you
off. But if you do, for goodness sake stop falling
over your sticks! Goodyear, you and Roeder had
better lay off awhile. Ridge and Pennimore!
Come and see if you can at least stay on your
feet. Hurry up, now. Let’s get some snap into
this. You’re letting the Second put it all over
you.”</p>

<p>But the next day the players showed some of
their old form and the Second had all it could do
to make its single tally. The weather remained
cold and the ice hard and firm. On Friday there
came indications of a thaw, and it wasn’t until
after nine o’clock that French was certain enough
of the morrow’s conditions to go to the telephone
and communicate with the manager of the Rock
Hill College team. “The ice may be a little soft
in spots,” he said over the wire, “but there’s no
doubt but that we can play. So we’ll expect you
down on the train that gets here at two sixteen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
We’ll play as soon after that as you’re ready.”
Alf’s last act that night before getting into bed
was to open the window and put his head out.</p>

<p>“What’s it doing?” asked Tom sleepily.</p>

<p>“Sort of cloudy, but it’s stopped dripping.
It’ll probably freeze a little before morning. I
wonder who invented the New England climate,
anyway. You never know one minute what it’s
going to do the next.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” murmured Tom, turning over in
bed with a grunt.</p>

<small>GERALD GOES ON AN ERRAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p>By eleven o’clock the next forenoon the thaw
had begun in earnest, but it was too late to cancel
the game. Rock Hill appeared on the scene
promptly and at a quarter to three the game began.
The ice was soft along the boards and there
was a film of water everywhere, but it was possible
to play for all of that. Felder was out of
the game with tonsilitis and Sanderson took his
place at cover point. The whole school turned
out to see the contest and lined the rink two and
three deep. Alf expected a hard game but defeat
was not reckoned on. Yet at the end of the first
twenty-minute period, with the score 2 to 0 in
Rock Hill’s favor, it didn’t look so improbable.
Rock Hill presented a team of older and more experienced
players and far excelled Yardley in
skating ability and stick work. Had it not been
for Dan’s really brilliant performance at the cage
the score would have been much larger. In the
second half Yardley had what benefit there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
from the wind, but, in spite of that, the play remained
about her goal most of the time and that
Rock Hill was able to add but one tally to her
score was due to good work on the part of the
defense, and the fact that Rock Hill’s shooting
was not as brilliant as her other game. With the
score, 3 to 0, and some four minutes to play, Alf
saved the home team from a shut-out by taking
the puck himself the length of the rink and, with
one short pass to Hanley and back in front of
goal, scoring Yardley’s only tally. But there was
no disgrace in being beaten by Rock Hill, and, on
the whole, Yardley’s work showed a distinct advance
over that of the game with the Yale freshmen.
If the Blue could play as well a week from
that day, when she was due to meet the Green,
Alf believed that the Pennimore Cup and the season’s
championship would remain at Yardley.</p>

<p>But the weather was to be reckoned with, it
seemed, for all Saturday and Sunday and Monday
the warm spell continued, until the hockey
rink was a shallow puddle of water with not a
vestige of ice to be seen. The river broke up and
the last of the snow melted in the drifts. The
weather was almost springlike and Alf fumed
and fretted and studied the predictions. And,
meanwhile, the only practice to be obtained was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in the gymnasium where, with two Indian clubs
set up to indicate a goal, the fellows shot until
their arms ached.</p>

<p>But winter was only sulking in his tent, and
on Tuesday morning the thermometer began to
go down. By night the mercury was hovering
about thirty and Alf went to sleep hopefully. The
ground was hard in the morning, but the noon
sun thawed it out again. Alf never entered or
emerged from Oxford that he didn’t pause to
scowl at the big thermometer by the door. Toward
evening a breeze sprang out of the north
and the mercury dropped ten degrees in half an
hour. Moreover, it continued to drop all night
and in the morning it showed twenty-one degrees.
The weather was cloudy and at noon it was snowing
fitfully. The rink was frozen smooth and
hard and practice began again that afternoon.
Alf once more wore a cheerful countenance. In
the locker room at the gymnasium afterwards he
called across to Gerald: “Say, Gerald, we’ve got
to get that cup back before the game. Do you
mind doing it? You’d better run over to-morrow
if you can find time.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Gerald. “I’ll attend to
it, Alf. I suppose he will give it to me, won’t he?”</p>

<p>“Who? Proctor? I guess so, but I’ll give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
you an order. Remind me to write it this evening.”</p>

<p>Gerald’s opportunity came after dinner the
following day. He had no recitations between
two and three and so, armed with Alf’s note to
the store proprietor, he tramped over to Greenburg
in the teeth of a northeast gale and got the
cup. He wanted very much to warm himself with
a hot chocolate, but they had agreed that it would
be wise to stay away from Wallace’s until last
week’s episode of the broken glasses had been forgotten,
and, since Wallace’s was the only place
where they knew how to prepare a hot chocolate
properly, Gerald was forced to start on his homeward
trip without refreshment. The cup was in
its maroon-colored flannel bag and he tucked it
under his arm so that his hands might have the
benefit of his coat pockets. When he reached the
bridge over the river he heard his name called
and, looking down, saw Harry Merrow on the ice.
There were several other boys with him, mostly
youngsters, and Jake Hiltz was sitting near by
struggling with a refractory skate strap.</p>

<p>“Going to skate?” asked Harry. Gerald shook
his head and danced up and down in the effort
to bring warmth into his numbed toes. Harry
eyed the maroon bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you doing with your skates, then?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“It’s not skates,” said Gerald. “It’s the
hockey cup. I’ve been over to Greenburg
for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you had your skates there.
Why don’t you get them and come on down? The
ice is dandy.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got hockey practice in half an hour,
Harry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot. Are you going to make the
team? Arthur says you’re a good player.”</p>

<p>“I won’t make it this year, I guess,” Gerald
answered. “Isn’t it cold? I must go on or I’ll
freeze fast to the bridge here.”</p>

<p>In his room he took the cup out of the bag
and set it on the table, tossing the bag aside, and
while he warmed himself at the radiator he admired
it and wondered whether Yardley would be
able to keep it out of the clutches of her rival.
It would, he reflected, be an awful shame if Broadwood
should succeed in winning it for good. But
whoever won it, he was going to see that there
was another cup to take its place. After awhile
it occurred to him that if he was not going to be
late for hockey practice he would have to hurry.
So he left the room, ran downstairs and sped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
across the yard to the gymnasium. Alf and some
of the others were just starting down to the rink
as he reached the door.</p>

<p>“I got the cup, Alf,” he said. “It’s in my
room. Shall I bring it over this evening?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, you might as well keep it until
Saturday, I guess. Get your togs on, Gerald, and
hurry down. If Andy comes in tell him I’ve gone
ahead.”</p>

<p>There was a stiff practice that afternoon, a
good three quarters of an hour of it, followed by
two twenty-minute periods with the Second Team,
for to-morrow’s session was to be brief and light,
only sufficient to keep muscles limber. Gerald
took part in the preliminary work and then
wrapped himself against the cold and became official
timekeeper while the First and Second
Teams went at each other hammer and tongs.
The weather was conducive to fast work, and in
the first period Alf’s players managed to score
four goals to the Second’s one. In the second
half all the substitutes had their chances and Gerald
tried his best to make good. But he was over-anxious
and, being light, always got the worst of
it in a mix-up. Eager to distinguish himself, he
over-skated time and again and lost the puck, and
Alf called constant warnings to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Careful, Gerald! There, you’ve done it
again! Use both hands on that stick, man! You
can’t do anything that way!”</p>

<p>He turned to Dan and added: “If Gerald
could use his stick as well as he can use his skates
he would make a good player.”</p>

<p>Dan smiled.</p>

<p>“He’s probably thinking that this is his last
chance this year, Alf, and he wants to make a hit.
He— Gee, he will get killed if he tries that sort
of thing!”</p>

<p>“Come now, Gerald!” sang out Alf. “This
isn’t a slugging match! Keep your stick down
and look what you’re doing. You, too, Roeder!
Follow up, man, follow up!”</p>

<p>The Second managed to score twice in that
half and the First broke through the opposing defense
for four more goals. Then Andy called a
halt and, in spite of Alf’s pleading for “another
five minutes, Andy,” drove them off the ice. After
they had had their showers and had dressed,
Alf and Dan and Gerald left the gymnasium together.</p>

<p>“What was the matter with you this afternoon,
Gerald?” asked Alf with a smile. “You
looked as though you were trying to kill the whole
Second Team.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Got sort of excited, didn’t you, chum?”
laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, you mustn’t get excited,” Alf said.
“If you do you can’t play good hockey. You’ve
got to keep cool all the time and know just what
you’re doing. Let the other side lose their heads.
If they do you’ve got the game cinched. Just as
soon as you go up in the air you forget all about
formation and begin to play the game all by your
lonesome. And as soon as you do that you’ll find
that the other chaps are eating you up, goal after
goal. Remember that, kid. Next year you try
again. You’ll be a good deal heavier then, I guess,
and I don’t see why you shouldn’t make the team.
And get your Y,” he added with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get it before then,” said Gerald
gravely. “I’m going out for the Track Team,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course; I’d forgotten. Well, I hope you
win a few points for us, Gerald. For in spite of
Tom’s blathering I have an idea that it isn’t going
to be so much of a walk-over after all. You got
the cup, you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I wanted a hot chocolate but I
didn’t dare go into Wallace’s for it. I pretty
nearly froze coming home.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you had gone into Wallace’s he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
have made it warm for you,” laughed Alf. “Coming
over this evening, Dan? You’d better. Tom’s
going to Oxford, I think; they’ve got one of their
amateur vaudeville entertainments on for to-night.
Tom just dotes on hearing rag-time music
and seeing fellows take paper flowers out of a
derby hat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll drop in for awhile,” answered Dan.
“My, but it certainly is cold!”</p>

<p>“It’s great! I hope it stays just this way until
after Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Well, Saturday is bound to be a cold day
for somebody,” replied Dan. After which <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon
mot</i> he and Gerald scuttled for Clarke.</p>

<p>It was dark when they reached the room, and
while Dan found the matches and lighted the gas
Gerald took his coat off. He was hanging it on
its hook in his closet when Dan spoke.</p>

<p>“Where did you put the cup?” he asked.</p>

<p>“On the table there under your nose,” replied
Gerald.</p>

<p>“On the table? Well, maybe you did, but it
isn’t here now.”</p>

<small>THE CUP DISAPPEARS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Then you’ve got it in your hand,” said Gerald
untroubledly and without turning.</p>

<p>“I haven’t! I tell you it isn’t here!”</p>

<p>“Not there!” Gerald turned and stared at the
table and from the table to Dan’s hands and from
thence to his face. “But—why, I put it there not
two hours ago!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” Dan looked about the room.
“Didn’t you tuck it away in a drawer somewhere?”</p>

<p>“No, I took it out of the bag and put it right
here on the table.” Gerald placed his hand on
the spot. “And then I went over there to the
radiator and warmed my hands and feet and
looked at it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s mighty funny,” grumbled Dan.
“You’d better look in your bureau, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I left it there, Dan!” Nevertheless
Gerald opened the drawers one after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
other and peeked in. “It was there when I went
out. I didn’t touch it after I took it out of the
bag.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with the bag?” asked Dan,
making an unsuccessful search among the cushions
of the window seat.</p>

<p>“Tossed it on the table. Isn’t it there?”</p>

<p>“Not a sign of it.” Dan thrust his hands in
his pockets and frowned across at his roommate.
“Look here, chum, this is sort of peculiar. Are
you certain you went for it?”</p>

<p>“Am I certain—” began Gerald exasperatedly.
“Don’t be silly, Dan! Of course, I’m certain. I’m
not likely to forget it, for I almost froze coming
home.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t drop it on the way? Or leave it
anywhere?”</p>

<p>“I brought it up here and put it on the table
there,” answered Gerald decidedly and a trifle
impatiently. “Some one has taken and hidden
it; that’s all there is to it; and I think it’s a pretty
poor joke.”</p>

<p>“Was anyone with you?”</p>

<p>“No, I was alone. Let’s look around the room.
Some fellow must have stuck it away somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see who could have done that,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Dan. “I don’t believe anyone has been in
here this afternoon except you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” answered
Gerald crossly. “I know I left it there and now
it’s gone. Look under your bed, Dan.”</p>

<p>They searched the room thoroughly, looked
under the beds and the window seat and the chiffoniers,
peered into the dark corners of the
closets, pulled things off the shelves, investigated
the mattresses and, in short, turned the place upside
down. Then they sat down and stared at
each other.</p>

<p>“Well, it beats me,” said Dan hopelessly.
“All I can think is that you imagined it, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t imagine it, I tell you! Did you look
thoroughly in your bureau?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dan replied, but went back to it and
took everything out of the drawers, and Gerald
did the same with his belongings. Then they
lifted photograph frames and looked behind the
radiator and searched in equally impossible
places. Finally Dan sank into a chair and Gerald
subsided on his bed.</p>

<p>“It isn’t in this room,” said Dan decidedly.
“Either you imagined that you brought it up
here, Gerald, or some one has been in and taken
it away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then some one has taken it,” said Gerald decisively.
“Do you suppose Tom could have come
in and seen it and taken it over to Dudley?”</p>

<p>Dan’s face cleared.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that’s just what happened,” he said.
“We’ll stop there when we go to supper and find
out. It couldn’t have been anyone but Tom. Alf
was at hockey and no one else would have any
right to touch it. Let’s wash up and run over
there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose anyone would steal it,” said
Gerald half questioningly.</p>

<p>“Steal it! Of course not! No one ever gets
up here but the fellows and the chambermaids and
the faculty. Besides, it isn’t likely that a thief
would have taken the bag too.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s so,” Gerald agreed. “I guess
Tom found it and thought Alf wanted it over
there.”</p>

<p>But that theory was short-lived. When they
reached 7 Dudley they found Tom and Alf just
leaving the room to go to commons for supper.</p>

<p>“Say, Tom, did you burglarize our room this
afternoon?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“If I did I’ll bet I didn’t get much,” was the
answer. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get the cup?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“The cup? What cup are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“The hockey cup. Quit fooling, Tom. You
took it, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Tom saw by the earnest look on Dan’s face
that that youth was not joking and so he answered
seriously:</p>

<p>“I haven’t been near your room to-day, Dan.
What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Why, Gerald says he brought the hockey cup
home from Greenburg and put it on the table and
left it there when he went to practice. It isn’t
there now and we’ve searched high and low for it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny game,” said Alf anxiously.
“Is that straight, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The only thing I could think of was
that Tom had happened in and taken it over here.”</p>

<p>“Have you looked everywhere in the room?”</p>

<p>“Rather! The place looks like a pigsty;
we’ve pulled everything out of the drawers and
even looked under the mattresses. Oh, it isn’t
there, Alf. Some one, I don’t know who, has taken
it out of that room. I suppose they’ve done it
for a joke, but if I catch them I’ll show them who
the joke is on.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go over to supper. Afterwards
we’ll go up to your room and see if we can’t find
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re welcome to look,” said Dan impatiently,
“but I tell you it isn’t there.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps whoever swiped it will bring it
back by that time,” said Tom cheerfully. “I
guess some fresh chump saw it and thought he’d
have some fun with you fellows.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be there when he returned it,”
growled Dan, as they hurried across to Whitson
and supper.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they climbed the stairs to
28. They all more than half expected to see the
silver trophy standing on the table when Dan
threw the door open. But it wasn’t there. Alf
made the other three sit down and himself began
a systematic search of the premises. At the end
of ten minutes, however, he was forced to agree
with Dan and Gerald. The Pennimore Cup was
not in 28 Dudley, wherever it might be. Dan sat
down and took one knee into his hands.</p>

<p>“Now let’s get at this thing,” he said. “Tell
us just what happened after you got to Proctor’s
store, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“I gave him your note and told him I’d come
to take the cup back. He went to the window and
got it and put it in the flannel bag. I took it
and walked home with it and when I got up
here——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” Alf interrupted. “Didn’t
you say you stopped and got a hot chocolate somewhere?”</p>

<p>“No, I said I wanted to, but I was afraid that
if I went into Wallace’s he would recognize me
and make a fuss about his broken glasses.”</p>

<p>“So you didn’t stop anywhere after you left
Proctor’s?”</p>

<p>“No, not until I got to the bridge.”</p>

<p>“The river bridge? Why did you stop there?”</p>

<p>“Because Harry Merrow called to me. He
and some other chaps were skating just above the
bridge.”</p>

<p>“What did he want?” asked Alf.</p>

<p>“He asked if I was going to skate. He thought
the bag was a skate bag, you see. I told him I
had the cup in it.”</p>

<p>“Then what?”</p>

<p>“Then,” continued Gerald, trying hard to recall
the conversation, “he asked me to go and get
my skates and said the ice was fine. I said I had
to report for hockey practice. He asked if I expected
to make the team and I said not this year.
And then I was cold and came on home.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with the cup while you were
talking?”</p>

<p>“I kept it under my arm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure? You didn’t set it down anywhere—say,
on the top of the bridge girder?”</p>

<p>“No, it was under my arm all the time.”</p>

<p>“All right. You brought it straight up here.
Didn’t stop anywhere else first?”</p>

<p>“No, I came right up to the room and took
the cup out of the bag and put it there. And I
tossed the bag about here. Then I went over to
the radiator and stood there about ten minutes,
I guess, getting my feet and hands warm. And
I was looking at the cup and wondering if we
would win it. I remember thinking that if Broadwood
got it for keeps I’d have dad present another
one.”</p>

<p>“Good idea, Gerald. Then what happened?”</p>

<p>“Then I remembered that I’d have to hurry
to get to practice on time, and so I——”</p>

<p>“Picked up the cup and put it away. Where
did you put it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t touch it, Alf! I just left it where
it was and went over to the gym.”</p>

<p>“Did you close the door as you went out?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I—I think so. I’m not sure. I was in a
hurry, you know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t remember hearing it close behind
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t. But I’m sure I <em>almost</em> closed
it, Tom.”</p>

<p>Tom arose and went into the hall, leaving the
door some six inches ajar. Then he returned and
opened it wider, and finally he came back, closing
it behind him.</p>

<p>“The door would have to be almost half
open,” he reported, “for anyone in the corridor
to be able to see the cup where Gerald put it.
You’re sure you didn’t leave it that far open,
Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Positive,” was the reply. “I may not have
latched it, but——”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” Dan interrupted. “The
window at the end of the corridor was open at
the top this afternoon. I remember that because
it was so blamed cold when we came up before
supper.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Alf. “That
some one might have got in that window?”</p>

<p>“Of course not! I mean that if there was a
draft in the hall this door might have blown open
if Gerald didn’t latch it as he went out.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. How was it when you came
back?”</p>

<p>“Closed,” answered Dan promptly.</p>

<p>“Shut tight,” agreed Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks, then, as though some one might have
been in,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” said Dan. “There’s no question
about that, Tom. Gerald is sure he left
the cup here on the table and now it’s gone.
Some one came in, all right enough, but who
was it?”</p>

<p>“Who is this Merrow chap?” asked Tom.
“Is he the youngster that rooms with Arthur
Thompson, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“You remember Merrow,” said Alf impatiently,
“the kid that Gerald and Thompson pulled
out of Marsh Lake last spring?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Well, he isn’t the sort to try a joke
like this, is he? You see, he seems to be the only
one that knew Gerald had the cup.”</p>

<p>“Not the only one,” said Gerald. “There
were six or seven other fellows around there;
Craig and Milton and—and Bicknell; I don’t remember
the rest; two or three of them I didn’t
know. And Hiltz was there, too, only he was
farther away.”</p>

<p>“Hiltz!” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Hiltz,” murmured Alf. The three exchanged
questioning glances.</p>

<p>“Was he near enough to hear what you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Merrow were saying?” asked Dan. Gerald considered.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. He might have heard,
though. You know voices sound pretty plain on
the ice.”</p>

<p>“How far was he from where you were?”</p>

<p>“About seventy-five or eighty feet, I think.”</p>

<p>“Was he nearer than that to Merrow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Merrow was about twenty feet from
the bridge. Hiltz was sitting on the bank at the
right. I suppose he was fifty feet from Harry.”</p>

<p>“What do you think?” asked Alf, turning to
Dan. Dan shook his head in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “He might have.
Maybe he thought it would be a good way to get
even with the three of us at one fell swoop. By
the way, where does he live?”</p>

<p>“In Whitson; second floor,” answered Tom.
“I don’t know his number, though.”</p>

<p>“If we could find out what he did after Gerald
left him,” muttered Dan. “Harry Merrow might
know how long he was on the ice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he might have come in here any
time during the two hours from three to five.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if he meant to swipe the cup he
would have done it while he was certain that both
Gerald and I were at hockey practice, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
would probably have done it early in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have been a hard thing to do,”
said Tom. “He knew you were both on the ice,
there aren’t many fellows around at half past
three, say, and on a cold day like this most every
fellow that is at home keeps his door closed. He
might have walked in here, taken the cup, put it
under his coat and walked out again, and no one
would have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Suppose he did,” said Alf. “What do you
think he would do with it? Hide it in his room?”</p>

<p>“Not likely, I guess,” answered Tom, “but
still he might. There are plenty of places around
the school he might have put it. If we were only
certain he had taken it——”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” growled Alf. “We can’t
go to him and say, ‘Hiltz you stole the Pennimore
Cup out of Dan’s room this afternoon and we
want it back!’ After all, I don’t believe Hiltz is
a thief.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he is,” said Dan, “and he
probably wouldn’t call it thieving. If he has
taken it he’s done it just to make trouble for us
and with no idea of keeping the cup himself.
Probably he means to return it before the game,
or leave it where it will be found.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s just the same as stealing,” exclaimed
Gerald angrily, “and I’ll bet he did it! He knew
I had it and he hates me like poison since I beat
him in the cross-country, and more since I got
into Cambridge. And he hates Dan for defeating
him at the election.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m inclined to think you’re right, Gerald,”
said Alf. “But the question before the
meeting is: What are we going to do? We’ve
got to get hold of that cup before the game on
Saturday, and to-morrow’s Friday. We’d look
like a pretty lot of idiots if we had to tell Broadwood
that we’d lost the cup! I wish we hadn’t
gone and exhibited it in Proctor’s window.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got to get hold of it before Saturday,”
said Dan. “What we’d better do, I guess,
is to report it to Mr. Collins. On the face of it
it’s a plain case of theft, and we’re not supposed
to have any suspicions of Jake Hiltz.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I guess,” agreed Alf. “Perhaps
Collins can scare whoever took it into giving it
back. Anyhow, I’ve got to go home and study.
Suppose you and Gerald come over after study
hour and we’ll find Collins and put it up to him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Dan agreed. “But I would like
to know where Hiltz spent his afternoon!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>GERALD WATCHES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a sensation the next morning when
Mr. Collins announced after Chapel that the
hockey cup had disappeared from No. 28 Clarke.
“It is only to be supposed,” said the assistant
principal, “that whoever took the cup out of the
room did so as a joke. If the person will return
the cup this morning, before dinner-time, I shall
consider it a joke, too, although a joke in rather
poor taste. If the cup is not returned by that
time I shall see that the offender is punished.
The Pennimore Cup is school property and there
is, as you all know, a severe penalty for damaging
or removing property belonging to the school.
Aside from this consideration, the cup is needed
to-morrow when Broadwood comes here to play
hockey, and it should be the effort of every fellow
to see that it is returned promptly to the office or
to the manager or captain of the hockey team.”</p>

<p>The school in general accepted the disappearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of the cup as a very excellent jest, and fellows
begged each other playfully to “give it up.
We know you’ve got it. Be good and hand it
back!” But when, in the afternoon, it was
learned that the missing trophy had not been returned
the amusement changed to indignation.
By that time Alf was thoroughly worried, and
the short practice went somewhat listlessly. Gerald
had seen Harry Merrow and had learned from
that youth, first swearing him to secrecy, that
Jake Hiltz had been on the river for at least half
an hour after Gerald had stopped on the bridge.
After that Harry knew nothing of Hiltz’s whereabouts.
Gerald reported this to Dan and Alf and
Tom after practice.</p>

<p>“I say let’s find Hiltz and put it up to him,”
said Dan impatiently. “We could say that he
was seen in the building yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“That would be a lie, wouldn’t it?” asked
Tom mildly.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t a lie excusable in a case of this
sort?” retorted Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. You don’t, either, Dan. A
lie’s a lie, no matter when you tell it.”</p>

<p>“Well, what in thunder <em>can</em> we do?” Dan demanded,
yielding the point without argument.</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything,” said Alf bitterly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
“except wait in the hope that whoever took the
cup will bring it back before the game to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But that’s poppycock,” said Dan. “If he
had been going to return it he would have done
it to-day before dinner and got off without
trouble. Now he knows that Collins will make it
hot for him. I wouldn’t be surprised if we never
saw that cup again!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Gerald, “if it didn’t come
back dad could have another made; he’d be glad
to, I know. But——”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile we’ve got to tell Broadwood that
we’ve lost it!” interrupted Alf.</p>

<p>“We haven’t lost it; it’s been stolen,” Tom
corrected.</p>

<p>“It amounts to the same thing. We haven’t
got it, have we? They’ll think it’s a fine joke and
have the laugh on us.”</p>

<p>“Let them,” said Tom. “If we beat them to-morrow
I guess they can laugh all they want to.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we won’t beat them,” muttered Alf
discouragedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, buck up, Alf! Of course we’ll beat
them!” said Dan heartily. “Let’s forget about
the cup until to-morrow. There’s nothing more
we can do. Don’t let it get on your nerves, Alf;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
you want to be able to play your best game, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s got on my nerves already,”
replied Alf with an attempt at a smile. “Well,
you’re right, though; we’ve done all we can do,
that’s certain. Unless we find Hiltz and choke
him until he ’fesses up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he has it—somehow,” mused
Dan.</p>

<p>“I know he has!” said Gerald positively.</p>

<p>“How do you know it?” Tom demanded. But
Gerald only shook his head.</p>

<p>“I just do,” he answered. “I—I feel it!”</p>

<p>“I wish you could see it instead of feeling it,”
said Alf, with a laugh, as he got up. “Hang that
cup, anyway! I’m going to supper. A fellow
has to eat, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I have to,” said Tom, following his
example. “I’ve got an appetite to-night, too. I
suppose that under the unfortunate circumstances
I ought not to be hungry, but I am.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Dan quite cheerfully. “Anyway,
we won’t find the cup by sitting here and
talking about it. I’m not going to think any
more about the pesky thing. Perhaps it will
show up in the morning somehow. Come on,
Gerald.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not hungry,” answered his roommate
dolefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are,” said Dan laughingly. “Or
you will be when you get to commons. Think of
the nice hot biscuits, Gerald!”</p>

<p>Gerald, however, refused to be comforted and
followed the others over to Whitson with lugubrious
countenance. Truth, though, compels me to
state that ten minutes later Gerald was doing
quite well with those same hot biscuits!</p>

<p>Saturday morning came and the mystery of
the Pennimore Cup was still unexplained. Mr.
Collins made another plea for its return and
threatened to expel the one who had taken it if
it was not forthcoming at once. The students
listened in respectful silence, but no one arose
dramatically and produced the missing cup. All
sorts of theories were going the rounds by now.
The most popular one was to the effect that a professional
thief had seen the cup in the window in
Greenburg and had followed Gerald back to school
and had later sneaked up to his room and stolen
it. It was quite plausible and there was a general
sentiment to the effect that Gerald had had a
lucky escape from being robbed on the way from
Greenburg, in which case he might have been
killed by the desperate burglar. Few any longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
believed that the cup had been taken as a practical
joke, and, when dinner-time arrived and it
had not appeared, even Alf and Dan and Tom
abandoned their first suspicions. Only Gerald
was obdurate.</p>

<p>“Hiltz took it,” he affirmed stoutly, “and he’s
got it now.”</p>

<p>And nothing any of the others could say in
any way affected his conviction.</p>

<p>Alf gave up hoping. His dejection, however,
had turned to anger, and Dan was glad to see it,
since it promised better results on the rink than
the captain’s half-hearted, down-in-the-mouth condition
of yesterday.</p>

<p>“As soon as the game is over,” declared Alf
wrathfully, “I’m going straight to the police.
That’s what we ought to have done yesterday
morning instead of letting Collins sputter about
it all this time. Maybe if we had we’d have the
cup now.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better tell Collins first, though,”
said Dan. “If the police are to be called in I
suppose he’d better do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell him. But if he doesn’t get the
police I will. The whole thing’s a disgrace to
the school!”</p>

<p>The hockey game was to start at three, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
an hour before that time the advance guard began
to arrive from Broadwood and Greenburg.
It was a glorious day, cold enough to keep the
ice hard and mild enough to allow spectators to
watch the game in comfort. There was scarcely
a ripple of air, and what there was blew softly
out of the southwest and was too kindly to bite
ears or nip noses. At half past two three big
coaches climbed the hill containing the Broadwood
team and as many of its loyal supporters
as had been able to crowd into the vehicles.
Others had already arrived on foot and more followed.
As it was Saturday afternoon many
Greenburg enthusiasts swelled the throng of students,
and long before either team appeared on
the ice the rink was fringed four deep with spectators
and all sorts of contrivances had been fashioned
by late arrivals from which to look over
the heads of those in front. French had requisitioned
as many settees as he could find, and these
were supplemented with boxes and planks, and
finally the locker room in the gymnasium was almost
denuded of its benches and would have been
quite cleared had not Mr. Bendix happened along
and forbidden farther spoliation.</p>

<p>Gerald accompanied Dan to the gymnasium
when it came time to get dressed. Gerald’s work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
was over for the season and to-day, like the members
of the Second Team and its substitutes, he
was only a member of the audience. He hung
around while the others got into their playing
togs, good-naturedly helping here and there.
Broadwood was dressing upstairs. When the
team were ready Alf spoke to them quietly and
confidently, begging them to keep together and
not to sacrifice team work for individual effort.
Then, clad in coats or dressing gowns, with their
skates, shoes, and sticks in hand, they filed out of
the gymnasium and walked down to the rink.</p>

<p>Their appearance was the signal for an outburst
of cheers that lasted for several moments.
A minute or two later they took possession of the
rink and began warming up. The ice was in fine
shape, hard and smooth, and the skates rang
merrily as they charged up and down. Sticks
clashed and pucks flew back and forth, often
whizzing into the crowd and causing heads to
duck. Broadwood appeared soon and received
her meed of acclaim. Then for some ten minutes
the teams practiced. Yardley wore white running
trunks over dark blue tights, white shirts
and blue knitted caps. Broadwood was attired
in dark-green stockings, khaki knickerbockers,
green shirts and green caps. The shirts bore, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a rule, a white B intersected by crossed hockey
sticks. Of the Yardley players, five flaunted on
their shirts a blue Y with a smaller H and T at
right and left. At a minute or so after three the
referee called the teams together and read them
the usual lecture in regard to tripping, body
checking, and so on. Then he tossed a coin, Alf
called it, and the Blue took the north goal. The
line-up was as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Hockey_Lineup">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Hanley, l. e.</td>
  <td class="tdr">r. e., Took</td>

  <td class="tdl">Vinton, g.</td>
  <td class="tdr">g., Chisholm</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Silence fell as the referee held his whistle to
his lips in the center of the rink and prepared to
drop the puck.</p>

<p>“Now, get your men, fellows, and play fast!”
called Alf.</p>

<p>The whistle blew and the puck dropped to the
ice. There was a moment’s clashing of sticks
and then it went back to Durfee who started along
the boards with it. The enemy was on him in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
moment, though, and Graham, captain of the
Green, stole away with it, Durfee slashing wildly
at his feet and stick.</p>

<p>“Cut that out, Durf!” shouted Alf. “Play
the puck! Get in there, Felder, and break that
up!”</p>

<p>Broadwood had managed to get into formation,
her four big forwards strung out across the
rink and skating hard, with the puck sidling back
and forth from one to another. But it is one
thing to reach the threshold and quite another to
enter the door. Felder sent a Broadwood player
spinning and Goodyear, close behind, whipped
the puck away and started back with it. In a
twinkling the attacked were the attackers and
Yardley swung up the ice with Broadwood in hot
pursuit. Across went the disk to Hanley. Took,
of Broadwood, challenged unsuccessfully and
Hanley passed back to Roeder, who shot. But
his aim was poor and the puck banged against
the boards to left of goal. There was a spirited
scrimmage for its possession and finally Broadwood
got away with it. After that the play stayed
close to the center of the rink, neither one side
nor the other being able to get by the opposing
defense. Time was called frequently for off-side
playing, which slowed the game up considerably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The first score was made by Broadwood at the
end of eight minutes. She had carried the puck
down along the boards on the left, and Yardley
had foiled her attempts to uncover long enough
to shoot until the puck was past the front of the
goal. Then Took evaded Goodyear and Felder
and slipped the disk out in front of the cage.
There was a wild mix-up for an instant and then
the Broadwood sticks waved and Broadwood sympathizers
shouted. The Green had drawn first
blood, the puck getting past Dan’s skate and lodging
against the net just inside of goal.</p>

<p>“Never mind that!” called Alf. “Get after
them. And play together, fellows!”</p>

<p>Yardley evened things up shortly afterwards,
and there was no fluke about that score. The forwards
worked the puck down to within six yards
of goal and Hanley made a difficult shot from
the side. In less than a minute more the Blue
had scored again, Goodyear slamming the disk
through from a scrimmage. Then Broadwood
stiffened, and for awhile Yardley was kept busy
defending her goal. Dan made some remarkable
stops that wrought the audience up to a high
pitch of excitement and enthusiasm, but with only
a few moments to play the Green evened things
up with its second tally, the puck going by Dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
into the cage knee high and at such a clip that,
as he said afterwards, he scarcely saw it from the
time it left the ice until it was reposing coyly at the
back of the net. So the first half ended with the
score 2 to 2, and it was anybody’s game.</p>

<p>The two teams seemed to be pretty evenly
matched, for, although Broadwood outskated her
opponent, Yardley had the better of the argument
when it came to stick work. At passing Broadwood
was more adept and at shooting Yardley
appeared to excel, although so far she had had
fewer opportunities to prove it. As the teams
went off the ice Alf called to Gerald, who was
standing near by:</p>

<p>“Say, Gerald, will you do something for me?”
he asked. “I told Tom to bring that leather
wristlet of mine from the room and he forgot it.
Would you mind running up and getting it?
You’ll find it somewhere around; on the mantel,
I think, or maybe on the table. This wrist of
mine is as weak as anything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, glad to,” answered Gerald. “On the
mantel or table, you say? And if not there, look
for it, I suppose?” he added laughingly.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s there some old place. I saw it this
morning. You might look on top of the bureau.
Thanks, Gerald.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald hurried off up the path toward the
gymnasium. He didn’t want to miss any of the
game, and wouldn’t if he could find the wristlet
and get back within the ten minutes allowed for
intermission. At the gymnasium corner he cut
through between that building and Merle Hall
and crossed the Yard toward Dudley. He didn’t
meet a soul, nor was there anyone in sight. Yard
and buildings were alike deserted and all the
school was down at the rink.</p>

<p>The object of his journey wasn’t found at once,
for it was in none of the places mentioned by Alf.
But after a minute Gerald discovered it on the
floor, where it had probably dropped from the
top of the bureau. He thrust it into his pocket,
closed the door behind him and hurried back
along the corridor. But at the entrance he
stopped short and, after a moment, drew cautiously
into the shadow. For across the corner
of the Yard, at the farther entrance of Whitson,
stood Jake Hiltz.</p>

<p>“What’s he doing up here?” muttered Gerald
to himself. “Why isn’t he down at the rink? I’m
sure I saw him there before the game.”</p>

<p>Hiltz wore a long, loose ulster and appeared to
be deep in a study of the sky. He stood there fully
two minutes, while Gerald watched from his concealment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
But while he was ostensibly regarding
the heavens as though trying to decide whether it
was wise to venture out without an umbrella,
Gerald thought that his gaze frequently roamed
to the buildings around the Yard as though to
make certain that there were no eyes regarding
him from the windows. At last his mind seemed
to be set at rest, as far as the weather was concerned,
for, with his hands thrust into his coat
pockets, he stepped down from the doorway and
started briskly along the path toward Dudley,
whistling carelessly. And between his body and
his left arm the big ulster appeared to Gerald to
bulge suspiciously.</p>

<p>With a fast-beating heart Gerald turned and
sped back and down the corridor to No. 7. Once
inside he closed the door without quite latching
it, crossed the room and dropped out of sight of
door or windows between the two narrow beds.
Then he waited.</p>

<p>“Andy, I wish you’d wrap some tape around
here,” said Alf, presenting his wrist to the trainer.
“I sent Pennimore up for my wristlet but I guess
he couldn’t find it.”</p>

<p>“Lame, is it?” asked Andy. “That’ll fix it.
Tell Hanley not to over-skate, cap. He missed a
dozen passes last half. There you are,” he added,
as he snipped the end of the tape with his scissors.
“Are you going to put the subs in at the
end?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I can, Andy. Give me the word when
there’s a minute or two left, will you? All right,
fellows! Now let’s get this game. Hanley, you’ve
got to stop getting ahead of the line. You’re
missing the pass time and again. Keep back,
man; take your position from Roeder and watch
the puck. Durf, you’ve got to quit slashing with
that stick or you’ll be sitting on the boards; the
referee’s got his eye on you. Don’t get ruled off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
for the love of Mike! We’ve got all we can do
to win with seven men, let alone six. Come on
now and let’s get this game and nail it down!”</p>

<p>“What’s this we hear about no hockey cup,
Loring?” asked the Broadwood captain, skating
up as Alf jumped into the rink.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a bit of mean luck, Graham,” answered
Alf. “Some one bagged it out of the
room the other day and we haven’t laid eyes on
it since. We thought, of course, that some smart
Aleck had taken it for a joke, but I guess now it
was really stolen.”</p>

<p>“That’s hard luck,” said Graham. “I’m sorry.
I didn’t see the cup myself, but I heard it was a
dandy.”</p>

<p>“It was. It will be all right, of course; I
mean that if it doesn’t turn up there’ll be another
to take its place, but I suppose we can’t get a new
one made for a month or so. I’m awfully sorry
about it, and I feel rather cheap, too, having to
’fess up to you chaps that I’ve let it get away. If
I could find the fellow who took it I’d come pretty
near wringing his fool neck!”</p>

<p>The Broadwood captain smiled sympathetically
and the referee’s whistle summoned the players.
The spectators, who had many of them left
their positions to wander about, scurried back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the rink side. Joe Chambers searched feverishly
for his notebook—for the <cite>Scholiast</cite> would have
a full and detailed account of the game in its next
issue. Harry Merrow squirmed his way to the
front row between two good-natured Greenburg
citizens; Tom and Paul Rand mounted their box
near one corner of the rink; Andy Ryan snapped
his bag shut and compared his watch with that of
the timer’s; Yardley and Broadwood cheered
vociferously; the referee tossed the puck down
between the impatient sticks and the last half
began.</p>

<p>Up on the hill at that moment, in No. 7 Dudley,
Gerald was crouching on the floor and listening
anxiously for the sound of footsteps in the
corridor. They came finally, drawing nearer and
nearer, and at length stopping outside the door.
There was a knock, then silence. Another knock,
and the door swung softly inward. Cautious
footsteps crossed the floor to the table. Gerald
raised his head above the level of Tom’s bed.
Hiltz, his eyes fixed anxiously on the windows
and his ears straining for sounds in the building,
fumbled under his big ulster. Then the familiar
maroon-colored bag appeared and he laid it on
the table, the cup and base betraying their presence
by muffled rattling that sounded startlingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
loud in the silent room. Hiltz turned away, still
listening intently, and took one step across the
carpet. Then his gaze left the windows, traveled
half around the room and fell full on Gerald’s.</p>

<p>Hiltz uttered no sound, but the color fled from
his face, leaving it white and drawn. <a href="#i_fp270">His wide,
startled eyes held Gerald’s for a long moment.</a>
It was Gerald who finally broke the tension and
the silence. He arose, brushed the dust from his
knees and seated himself on Alf’s bed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">

  <img src="images/i_fp270.jpg" width="415" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_271">“His wide, startled eyes held Gerald’s for a long moment.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p>The color crept back into Hiltz’s cheeks and
his expression of fright gave place to one of sullen
defiance.</p>

<p>“Well?” he echoed.</p>

<p>“You’ve brought it back,” said Gerald, nodding
at the cup. “I said all along that you had
taken it.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t take it!” said Hiltz defiantly. “I
found it—just now—by accident, and——”</p>

<p>“Where did you find it?” asked Gerald coolly.</p>

<p>“In the cellar—in Whitson,” replied Hiltz, after
the barest instant of hesitancy.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to go there?” asked
Gerald with a smile. “You were at the rink half
an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“I went to get something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and you got it, and there it is. What’s
the use of lying about it, Hiltz?”</p>

<p>Hiltz’s gaze wandered to the door. Then he
shrugged his shoulders and sat down in a chair
by the table.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he said. “I took it. I guess
you know why.”</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head. “I don’t believe I do,
Hiltz. Why?”</p>

<p>“To make trouble for you and Vinton, of
course,” answered the other recklessly. “I didn’t
want the old cup; I wasn’t stealing it. I meant
to bring it back last night and put it in your room,
and I tried to, but there wasn’t any chance. There
were always fellows about, and after what Collins
said I didn’t want to be caught. I guess
you’ve got me where you want me now, Pennimore.
Of course, I might deny the whole thing,”
he went on musingly, “and say that you made up
the story, but I guess no one would believe me.”</p>

<p>Gerald considered judicially. Then he shook
his head.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe they would. You see,
Hiltz, we all suspected you from the first, but we
couldn’t prove anything. If you ask me, I think
it was a silly thing to do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t ask you,” said Hiltz angrily. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
don’t give a hang what you think. You don’t like
me and I don’t like you, and you can go to Collins
this minute, but I don’t have to listen to any of
your fool opinions.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you bring it back Friday morning,
when you had a chance, and say that it was
only a joke?” asked Gerald curiously.</p>

<p>“Because I wasn’t ready to. You and that
fool Vinton weren’t worried enough then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe either Dan or I worried half
as much as Alf did.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not crazy about Alf Loring,” answered
Hiltz with a shrug. “He did all he could
to help Vinton beat me for the committee. It
was none of his business.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. The only reason Dan wanted
to beat you was so I could get into Cambridge.
You kept me out last year, you know.”</p>

<p>“Who said so?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. I know it’s so.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if I did? I had a right to vote
against you, hadn’t I? We don’t want any of
your sort in Cambridge.”</p>

<p>“My sort? Just what is my sort?” asked
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know; stuck-up, purse-proud chaps
like you don’t mix with the rest of us. You think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
just because your father has gobs of money that
you’re a little better than we are. How did he
make his money, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Honestly,” answered Gerald quietly.</p>

<p>“Yah! That’s likely, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’s so, anyhow. He didn’t get it by lying
and stealing, Hiltz.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” demanded the
other suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what you’ve done, isn’t it?” said
Gerald. “You lied about me after the cross-country
trial and now you’ve stolen this cup.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to go over there and make
you eat those words, you little stuck-up cad!”
blazed Hiltz, half rising from his chair.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of you,” retorted Gerald, the
color rushing to his face. “You did lie when you
said I cheated and you did steal that cup!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t steal it, I tell you! I only took it
to worry you fellows, and I meant to bring it
back before you needed it this afternoon. And I
would have if Collins hadn’t threatened to expel
the fellow who took it.”</p>

<p>Gerald glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you returned it when you
did,” he said, “for now, if Broadwood wins, we’ll
be able to hand it over to her.” He glanced from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the cup to Hiltz and then examined his hands
frowningly for a moment. Finally:</p>

<p>“Look here, Hiltz,” he said, glancing across,
“I never did anything to you personally to make
you hate me so, did I?”</p>

<p>“Personally, no,” answered Hiltz. “I’d like
to see you!”</p>

<p>“Well, why have you got it in for me so?”</p>

<p>Hiltz’s gaze fell and he shuffled his feet impatiently.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just don’t like you. Tubby Jones was
my best friend here until Vinton made it so hot
for him he had to leave school. And then you
came and took Tubby’s place in No. 28, and so—”
Hiltz’s voice dwindled uncertainly into silence.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what I could do about it,” said
Gerald with spirit. “Tubby left school because
he got into some sort of trouble. That left Dan
alone and he asked me to come in with him. It
doesn’t make much difference to me, Hiltz, whether
you like me or don’t like me, only—I haven’t
done anything to you and I’d rather not have anyone
down on me if I can help it. You say I’m
stuck-up, but I don’t believe I am. I know there
are dozens and dozens of fellows here who are
smarter and nicer than I am and who haven’t got
wealthy fathers. Last year, when I first came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
here, lots of fellows used to call me names; Money-bags,
and Miss Nancy, and things like that. But
they don’t do it this year and so I—I was thinking
that they had forgotten about it and—and
sort of liked me. I can’t help it if my father has
a lot of money, Hiltz. I don’t see what that has
to do with me as long as I act decently.”</p>

<p>Hiltz was silent, his gaze fixed on his shoes.</p>

<p>“Do you?” asked Gerald after a moment.</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” growled Hiltz. “I didn’t say
I had any very good reason for disliking you; I
just said I—did.” Gerald smiled and Hiltz looked
up suddenly and saw it. “Oh, I know what you’re
after,” he broke out. “You want me to eat humble
pie and beg you to let me off and not tell Collins!
Well, I won’t, by Jove! You can go ahead
and tell him now. I can stand it. Being fired
isn’t going to kill me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to do anything of the sort,”
answered Gerald warmly. “I’ve never thought
of telling Collins.”</p>

<p>Hiltz viewed him incredulously.</p>

<p>“You haven’t! Why not?”</p>

<p>“Why should I? You say I don’t like you.
Well, I suppose I don’t. I couldn’t very well after
the way you’ve put it on me whenever you’ve
had the chance. But I don’t think I dislike you—very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
much. And I guess if you were decent to
me I could be decent to you, Hiltz. Anyway, I’m
sure I don’t want you expelled.”</p>

<p>“Then—what will you do?” asked Hiltz rather
more humbly.</p>

<p>“Take the cup down to the rink and hand it
over to French or Alf and tell them I found it
in this room.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Hiltz, his gaze returning to his
shoes. “And not say anything about me?”</p>

<p>“Not a word. Do you think anyone saw you
come up the hill?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. I left the rink just before
the first half was over and everyone was
looking at the players.”</p>

<p>“Then if I were you I’d go to my room and
stay there until the fellows get back. No one will
know then that you didn’t stay through the game.
Now I’d better take this down or the game will
be over.”</p>

<p>Gerald got up and put the cup under his arm.
Hiltz arose, too, and stood hesitating doubtfully
by his chair. At last:</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s the best thing to do,”
he said. “And—oh, I guess you know how I feel
about it, Pennimore. It’s decent of you, I’ll say
that, and I—I appreciate it. My folks would feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
like the dickens if Collins expelled me.” He
walked to the door, opened it and faced Gerald
again. “I guess you and I won’t—” he hesitated,
hunting his words—“won’t have any more
trouble, Pennimore.”</p>

<p>Then he disappeared and Gerald heard his
footfalls dying away in the corridor. For a minute
Gerald stood there frowning intently at the
closed door. Then he smiled slightly, glanced
again at his watch and left the building to hurry
across the Yard and down the hill with the Pennimore
cup hugged tightly under his arm.</p>

<p>Once past the gymnasium the sounds from
the rink reached him clearly; the grinding and
clanging of skates, the clatter of sticks, the cries of
the players and, at intervals, the savage, triumphant
cheers of the onlookers. From the slope of
the hill he could look over the heads of the spectators
around the rink and see the skaters charging
about on the ice, the blue and green costumes
bright in the sunlight. Even as he looked there
was a gathering of the players about the south
goal, a mad moment of excitement and then the
green-bladed sticks waved in air. Broadwood
had scored again! Gerald wondered if that goal
put the Green in the lead and hurried faster down
the path.</p>

<p>Play had begun again before he reached the
fringe of the crowd, but by the time he had
wormed his way through to the substitute bench
the whistle had sounded and the referee was in
the center of a group of protesting players.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Everyone was intent on the scene before him and
Gerald’s appearance went unnoticed. The referee,
shaking his head, backed away, motioning, and
Durfee of Yardley, and Took of Broadwood,
walked disconsolately and protestingly from the
rink.</p>

<p>“Slugging,” answered Sanderson in reply to
Gerald’s question. “Durfee’s been mixing it up
all the half and Took got mad and came back at
him. I don’t blame him. They had a lovely little
squabble down there in the corner. Didn’t
you see it?”</p>

<p>“I just got here,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Just got—” exclaimed Sanderson, looking
around at him where he was leaning over the
bench. “Where have you been? What’s that
you’ve got, Pennimore?”</p>

<p>But Gerald was trying to get Alf’s attention
and made no answer. Alf, finding that protests
were useless, was turning to skate back to his position
when he heard Gerald hail him. He looked
across and then skated up to the boards.</p>

<p>“Did you find it?” he asked. “Thought you’d
got lost. Let’s have it.” He began to peel the
tape from his wrist.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I found this, too, Alf,” said Gerald,
bringing the cup into sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Alf’s face lighted up when he saw it.</p>

<p>“Great! Where did you get it, kid?”</p>

<p>“Found it on the table in your room.”</p>

<p>“All ready, Yardley?” called the referee.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, please,” answered Alf, strapping
the wristlet on. “You say you found it on
the table in—” He stopped and viewed Gerald
suspiciously. “How did it get there?”</p>

<p>“That’s something I can’t tell you,” answered
Gerald with a smile.</p>

<p>“Can’t or won’t?” asked Alf frowningly.
“Well, never mind now. I’ve got to get back.
Take the bag off it, Gerald, and don’t let it out
of your hands until the game’s over. By Jove,
I’m glad you got it, wherever it came from!
You’re a trump, Gerald!”</p>

<p>He tossed the rejected tape onto the ground
and turned to skate away. But the next instant
he was circling back.</p>

<p>“Where are your togs, kid?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“In the gym,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Go up and get them on and hurry back!”</p>

<p>Then he was speeding off to his position.</p>

<p>Gerald stared after him. Get his togs on!
Why, that meant—meant that Alf was going to
let him into the game! Meant that he was to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
in the big contest! Meant that he was to get his
Y! For a moment he stood there motionless.</p>

<p>“Gee, you’re in luck,” said Sanderson enviously.
“Why don’t you get a move on, you
idiot?”</p>

<p>Then Gerald thrust the silver cup and the
ebony pedestal and the flannel bag into Andy
Ryan’s hands and fought his way out of the
throng and went tearing up the hill.</p>

<p>The half was ten minutes old and a like number
of minutes were left to play. Broadwood was
in the lead with three goals to Yardley’s two.
The playing in the second period had been fairly
even and the puck had been flying back and forth
from one end of the rink to the other. Dan had
spoiled two nice tries and the Broadwood goal
had three brilliant stops to his credit. Broadwood’s
score had come from a scrimmage in front
of the cage during which a Green forward had
found a moment’s opening and taken advantage
of it by whizzing the puck past Dan’s feet. Now
Yardley braced, however, and forced the fighting.
With but six men on a side the playing was more
open and it was harder to penetrate the defense.
Three times the Blue charged down to within
scoring distance only to lose the puck. Then the
penalized forwards came back into the game and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Durfee, as though to make up for the lost time,
sprang into the line, took the disk at a nice
pass from Roeder, evaded the Green’s point and
slammed the puck viciously past the goal tend,
tying the score again.</p>

<p>How Yardley shouted and cheered and pounded
the boards with her feet! “Four minutes to
play!” cried Ridge excitedly. “I’ll bet it goes to
an extra period!”</p>

<p>“Play together, fellows!” called Alf. “One
more like that!”</p>

<p>Again the puck was centered and again the
two teams sprang desperately into the fray.
Skates rang on the hard ice, sticks clashed and
broke, players stumbled and sprawled to the delight
of the cheering audience, the referee whistled
and interfered time and again and the precious
moments flew by. Warner, the Green’s right center,
getting the puck near his goal took it almost
alone the length of the rink amid the wild, expectant
acclaim of Broadwood, sent Felder flying
on his back and shot at goal. But the puck went
squarely against Dan’s padded leg, dropped to
the ice and was whisked aside before it could be
reached by the nearest green stick. Half a dozen
players met in the corner of the ice and fought
like maniacs for the disk. Finally it slipped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and was slashed toward the center in front of
goal. But before a Broadwood player could
reach it the referee’s whistle sounded.</p>

<p>“Time’s up!” was the cry along the boards.
But play had been stopped only for off side and
the referee motioned for the puck.</p>

<p>“A minute and a half, cap!” called Andy
Ryan. Alf heard and waved his hand, skating
across to the bench.</p>

<p>“Sanderson, you go in for Felder,” he called.
“Ridge at right center, Eisner at right end, Pennimore
at left center. Hurry up now!”</p>

<p>The changes were made, the deposed players
trailing regretfully from the ice to the tune of
Yardley cheers.</p>

<p>“That’s a risk, isn’t it, Alf?” asked Dan anxiously,
as Alf came back to position. “Putting
Gerald in, I mean.”</p>

<p>“He deserves it,” answered Alf. “Keep your
eyes open, Dan. There’s only a minute and a half.
If we can stave them off we’ll have a rest and
come back at them hard next period.”</p>

<p>The puck dropped to the ice and play went on
again. There was evident now a disposition on
each side to abandon team work and Dan cautioned
and implored almost unceasingly. Both
teams were anxious to score and the result was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that for the next minute neither came near doing
it. Then, with less than half a minute to play,
Hanley started off with the puck, pursued by the
Broadwood forwards, his own mates trying desperately
to get into position to help him. Down
near the Green’s goal the cover point challenged
him and Hanley passed to the left in the hope
that some one of his side would be there to take
the puck. As it happened some one was there.
It was Gerald, out of position and intent only on
getting the disk. Two Broadwood fellows reached
for it, but Gerald, skating fast, slashed their
sticks aside, got the puck, lost it, recovered it
again with a half turn, charged toward the cage
and shot blindly. As he did so the point drove
into his shoulder first. Gerald’s stick flew into
air and Gerald himself left his feet with a bound
and went crashing to the ice ten feet away. But
blue-tipped sticks were waving wildly in air and
Yardley cheers were ringing triumphantly, for the
puck lay snugly against the net at the back of
Broadwood’s goal.</p>

<p>Alf was the first to reach Gerald’s side and
his first glimpse of the pale face frightened him
badly. Andy Ryan hurried on and between them
Gerald was lifted up and carried off the ice and
laid on the substitute’s bench with a pile of sweaters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
under his head and a gayly hued dressing
gown over his body.</p>

<p>“Is he hurt badly?” whispered Alf.</p>

<p>Andy’s hands went down under the dressing
gown. Then he shook his head cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Stunned a bit,” he answered. “That’s all.
He hit on his head, likely. I’ll look after him. You
go back.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve nobody to put in,” said Alf.</p>

<p>“Play them with six,” replied Andy. “There’s
only a matter of four seconds left.”</p>

<p>Andy was right. The puck had no more than
been put in play when the timer shouted his warning
and the whistle blew. About the rink Yardley
triumphed and cavorted. On the ice two weary,
panting groups of players cheered each other
feebly. On the substitutes’ bench Gerald stirred,
sighed and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello, Andy,” he said weakly and puzzledly.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s up,” answered the
trainer dryly, “but you went down.”</p>

<p>“I remember.” Gerald felt of his head gingerly.
“Did I——?”</p>

<p>He looked the rest of his question anxiously.</p>

<p>“You did,” answered Andy. “If you don’t
believe me just listen to that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“That” was a wild tumult of Yardley joy.
Gerald smiled, and when he opened his eyes again
a moment later Dan and Alf were bending over
him solicitously.</p>

<p>“How do you feel, chum?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Gerald cheerfully.
“We won, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“You bet! Your goal saved the day, Gerald!”
answered Alf.</p>

<p>“And the cup,” added Gerald.</p>

<p>“And the cup,” Alf agreed smilingly.</p>

<p>“And—and—” Gerald’s voice sank—“do I
get my Y, Alf?”</p>

<p>“You bet you do!” answered Alf heartily.</p>

<p>“Then,” murmured Gerald, closing his eyes
again with a sigh and a smile, “I don’t mind
about my head, though it does hurt awfully!”</p>

to, Mr. Camp’s successful juvenile, “The Substitute.” It is
a story dealing principally with football in college, but including
rowing and other sports. Mr. Camp’s idea in this book
is to give a little more of a picture of college life and the
relations, friendships, enmities, etc., of the students rather
than to tell nothing but a football story. In other words, the
book is more of an attempt at the “Tom Brown at Rugby”
idea than a purely athletic story, although the basis of the
story, as in “The Substitute,” is still athletics.</p>

the daily work on the field.</p>

<p class="i2">This is an admirable story of the childhood and womanhood of the
celebrated author of “Little Women,” told with especial reference to
girl readers. Miss Moses has excellently caught the beautiful home
spirit of the Alcotts’s family circle, and this biography is not only charmingly
written but is in every way an authoritative account of the interesting
life of Miss Alcott and the New England scenes in which her days
were spent. It has been Miss Moses’s desire to give an intimate picture
of the home life of her heroine, her development of character, and the
influence upon her of the famous band of New England men and women
who made Concord and Boston centers of intellectual growth.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
